But the phenomenon is in fact much older and occurred for the f irst time in Central and Eastern Europe in the nineteenth century. In the eighteenth century, Frederick the Great of Prussia had developed the concept of the modern state – a state involving itself in all facets of society. This also led to the idea of ‘f iscal forestry’, i.e. forestry intended to f ill the coffers of the state. Pursued systematically, this approach showed that some trees and some areas of forest produced higher yields than others.

New research reveals these all to be illusions. Instead, the crisis has revolutionised citizens’ perceptions of global order – scrambling the distinctions between nationalism and globalism. One group – the DIYers – sees a nineteenth-century world of every nation for itself; the New Cold Warriors hear echoes of the twentieth century and look to Trump’s America to defend them from China; the Strategic Sovereigntists foresee a twenty-first-century world of blocs and regions. This last group are the largest and represent a new form of pro-European who believe Europe will need to support its own sovereignty through joint foreign policy, control of external borders, and relocalised production.

Since the nineties, several outbreaks have been reported in Asian countries, such as South Korea, China and Japan, and they have been characterized by relatively high mortality rates ranging from 50 to 95%, causing severe damage to the swine industry (Lee 2015; Song et al. 2015b ). In the late autumn of 2010, a large-scale outbreak of diarrhea characterized by severe watery diarrhea, dehydration with high morbidity and mortality emerged in a swine farm in southern China, and it has affected an estimated millions of piglets and greatly threatened the global swine industry. \n",

Assumptions All of the analysis in this document is based in the year 2016. We expect 2016 to be close to the “steady state” for the effects of the ACA because many of the law’s major components do not begin until 2014 and it will take a couple years for the population to fully react.

Parliament is deeply divided and lacks a clear foundation for stable and efficient policymaking, while the new president has neither political experience nor a party to implement his agenda. The 2019 elections may have finally ended the transactional power-sharing agreement forged by Ennahda and representatives of the old regime, which long ignored major socio- economic challenges.

Yet not-for- profit (NFP) organisations play a critical role within civil society more broadly, enabling democratic participation in myriad ways. These roles are not necessarily divergent, but they are reflective of the range of relationships and processes by which NFPs contribute to society. This chapter explores some of these relationships and processes and the contribution to civil society that NFP organisations make through them. It argues that a strong and independent civil society balances out the power and control that can otherwise be centralised in democratic governance and decision-making, enabling the participation of people and communities in the decisions made about them and facilitating le\n",

This model evolved in an era dominated by conditions that required acute care for conditions such as infections, injuries, and childbirth. The health care delivery systems, multilevel infrastructure for financing care, and even the predominant paradigm for innovation were shaped by that historical context. Thus, if one imagines the demand for health care as a pyramid, with the top representing high-tech care for acute health problems (such as cardiac surgery and bone marrow transplantation), and the bottom representing maintenance of the health, wellness, and productivity of the population, countries employing a Western-style model have devoted a\n",

The process of establishing an IM center in a hospital brought to the forefront long-standing tensions and changing attitudes of biomedical and CAM practitioners, and highlighted the factors that impede or facilitate integration. An IM center represents two distinct medical systems and philosophies. Biomedicine, with its disease focus and fairly homogeneous, vertically organized hierarchy of specialists and generalists, traces its philosophical roots and practices to rationalistic, quantitative western scientific traditions.

For example, smallpox in humans is related to mousepox or camelpox, but each can infect only a single species due to genetic differences that are in the range of only 1-2 % [2] . In the case of the Ebola virus, fruit bats are a likely reservoir, but, antilope, rodents, and perhaps other mammals may also play a role [1] . The virus can also be transmitted to humans from apes, which are accidental hosts. Ove\n",

Through this work we seek to deepen decisionmakers’ understanding of the multiple and overlapping gendered impacts of the COVID-19 crisis and the public health, economic, and social policy responses to it, as well as propose evidence-based solutions to support gender-inclusive recovery. The project focuses on three distinct yet related areas of the COVID-19 response and recovery: (1) indirect health impacts of the pandemic for women and girls; (2) inclusive and equitable social protection policy; and (3) promoting women’s economic opportunities and empowerment. Recognizing that much of the academic and policy dialogue around gender inequality in the COVID-19 context has largely emphasized challenges facing women and girls in high-income sett\n",

THREE FUTURE SCENARIOS Srini Sitaraman “Frontiers are indeed the razor’s edge on which hang suspended the modern issues of war or peace, of life or death to nations.” Lord Curzon Introduction The Greek historian Thucydides writing on the Peloponnesian War argued that when an established power encounters a rising power, the possibility of conflict between the established and rising power would become in- evitable.1 Graham T. Allison in his book, Destined for War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides’s Trap?, extended Thucydides’ primary argument by suggesting that the power dynamics between China and the United States is similarly poised, an established power—the United States—confronting an aggressive power in China may produce a military conflict between them.2 The Thucydides Trap argument has also been applied to the India- China conflict, in which India, a rising power, is confronted by China, the established power.3 But such comparisons\n",

Economic and human development indicators also attested to faster- than- usual improve- ments in health, educational and social conditions (AMF various years). That was Iraq then. When, in Geneva in 1991, US Secretary of State James Baker III warned Tariq Aziz, the deputy prime minister of Iraq, that Iraq would be bombed back into the Stone Age, he probably meant that the United States would deprive the Iraqi civilian population of the right to security of person, water, health, shelter and, more generally, the requirements for decent living.1 In 2015, Iraq has become a war- plagued and divided territory, and its fi rst prime minister in the Paul Bremer governme\n",

Second, the gray zone encompasses those areas of state competition where antagonistic actions take place; however, those actions fall short of the red lines that would normally result in armed conflict between nations. The lines between war and peace in the gray zone are blurred, and competition occurs across all instruments of national power. By leveraging a cre- ative strategy and hybrid tactics, Russia attempts to achieve its strategic objectives without compelling the United States to respond using military force. Exam- ples of gray zone tactics include cyberattacks, informa- tion operations and propaganda, deception, sabotage, proxy war, a\n",

These activities, commonly referred to as nature-based tourism or eco- tourism, constitute one of the fastest growing sectors of the travel market (World Tourism Organisation 2002). Increasing consumer choice and spending ability in developed countries has led to an ex- pansion of destinations catering to tourists demanding increasingly remote and unspoiled locations. Whilst the definition of ecotourism itself is subject to debate, most writers accept the following descrip- tion: ...[ecotourism is] environmentally responsible, enlightening travel and visi- tation to relatively undisturbed natural areas to enjoy and appreciate nature and any accompanying cultural features both past and present that promotes conservation, has low visitor impact and provides for benefi- cially active socio-economic involvement of local populations (Ceballos- Lascurain 1996). 151', 'This definition highlights the fact that although ecotourism should cause minimal disturbance to the natural environment, it should also bring about economic and social benefits to local communities. The degree to which ecotourism fulfils these objectives is to some ex- tent dependent upon the ability of government departments with ju- risdiction over protected areas to influence the development of ecotourism activities. In developing countries, this ability is severely restricted by a lack of resources, leading to many protected areas be- ing labelled ‘paper parks’ as a result of the lack of managerial control over activities within them (MacAndrews 1998). In analysing the impacts of ecotourism in developing countries, attention has progressed from a focus on purely economic or envi- ronmental benefits to an approach which adopts a development- oriented perspective (Scheyvens 1999). This latter approach em- phasises the need to facilitate community development through eco- tourism in a manner that empowers the local community in a num- ber of ways. Economic benefits are therefore seen not just in terms of total revenue but also with regard to the numbers of people involved and the extent to which these benefits are distributed within commu- nities. The development approach focuses on socio-cultural impacts. For example, whether ecotourism improves community cohesion through activities such as investing in communal facilities and rein- forcing the value of local traditions and the awareness of the natural environment. Attention is also paid in this analysis to the impact of ecotourism on local people’s ability to influence decisions regarding the management of the protected area. These impacts can be ana- lysed in terms of their capacity to empower the local community in economic, social and environmental terms. This paper will utilise a development approach to examine two contrasting tourism operations in a marine national park in Indone- sia which both advertise themselves under the banner of ecotourism. The analysis will demonstrate the contrasting impacts of ecotourism and identify issues related to the effective management of eco- tourism in developing countries. It is hoped that this will serve to un- derline the need to critically assess the value of marine ecotourism in terms of its impact on local communities and their ability to actively contribute and participate in the management of their local environ- ment. 152 Chapter Six', 'Figure 6.1. Location of Wakatobi Marine National Park. Background to Case Study Area The Wakatobi Marine National Park, located in the Tukang Besi is- lands of southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia (Fig. 6.1) covers a total area of 13,900 km2 and was officially designated in 1996, making it one of the largest and newest marine national parks in Indonesia. The park encompasses the four major islands of Wangi-Wangi, Kaledupa, Tomia and Binongko, which support a total of around 80,000 peo- ple, as well as sixteen smaller uninhabited islands and atolls. Arable and pastoral activities are mainly practised by the Wakatobi ethnic group, which constitutes around 92 percent of the islands’ popula- tion. The other group in the area are the Bajau or ‘sea gypsies’ who are scattered throughout coastal environments of Southeast Asia. These communities rely almost exclusively on marine resources for food, fuel and building materials, whilst engaging in small scale trad- ing of surplus fish catches with the Wakatobi. Surveys conducted by overseas non-governmental organisations in the early 1990s high- lighted the threat to marine biodiversity posed by the increasing use of destructive fishing practices by local communities subject to com- petition with outside fishermen, a factor common to many areas in Julian Clifton 153', 'Indonesia (Cesar et al. 1997). Proposals to establish an MPA were further justified through reference to the historical significance of Sulawesi in connection with the studies of Alfred Russel Wallace, as well as the potential to promote marine ecotourism in such a remote and relatively pristine area of Indonesia. This resulted in the rapid designation of the area as a marine national park in 1996, within 3 years of the initial proposal. Given its remote location, which until recently required a mini- mum of two days overland and sea travel from the nearest regional airport, it is not surprising that ecotourism is limited to two centres of activity in the Wakatobi. Despite their contrasting modes of opera- tion as detailed in Table 6.1, both operations promote themselves as ‘ecotourism’ in publicity materials, justifying this with references to economic and social benefits reaching local communities in their vi- cinity as well as their strategies relating to marine conservation. It is the intention of this study to analyse the differing economic, social and environmental impacts of these two examples of ecotourism, which will be henceforth referred to as ‘dive ecotourism’ and ‘re- search ecotourism’, reflecting their core clientele and main activities.

Whilst the capac- 154 Chapter Six', 'ity of the dive ecotourism operation has remained stable since its in- ception, its resort facilities are booked up for the duration of its open season, giving rise to a total of around 480 visitors per year. In con- trast, whilst the research ecotourism operation is only open to coin- cide with the university summer vacation in the UK and Ireland, there has been a rapid increase in total visitor numbers during this period from 50 in 1995 to 300 in 2001. Furthermore, in July 2001 the construction of an airstrip on the island of Tomia was completed. The presence of the airstrip, which had been privately financed by the dive ecotourism operation, re- duced the travel time from Bali to Tomia from two days to four hours. The implications of this with regard to the future develop- ment of ecotourism within the region will be discussed later in this paper. It is also worthwhile to note that there is very little personal or professional contact between the owners of these two ecotour opera- tions in the Wakatobi. Methodology Field research was conducted for two periods of eight weeks, one in 2000 and one in 2001. This was initiated through a series of inter- views with the owners and employees of the two ecotour resorts. The interviews explored a range of issues including daily operations, product marketing and the relationships between local communities and national park authorities. These were followed by interviews with local employees and individuals from communities located in close proximity to the two ecotour resorts. These interviews focused upon the extent to which economic and social benefits were reaching local communities and the nature of any perceived problems associ- ated with the presence of the ecotour operators. Interviews were con- ducted with the assistance of locally based translators and, in the case of the Bajau, questions were phrased in the Bajau dialect in order to ensure accuracy of response. Participant observation provided in- sights based upon informal discussions with a range of informants, together with notes of activities and interactions between local resi- dents and overseas visitors. Secondary sources of information were also utilised in the research. Analysis of available financial records from the ecotour operators was conducted to obtain additional eco- nomic data, and the socio-cultural impact of the ecotour operators was also addressed through analysis of web-based publicity material.

The issues of ethnicity and gender are, however, rarely explored together in relation to natural resource management. The present paper seeks to provide an overview of the present state of research dealing with indigenous peoples, gender and natural resource management. It examines the position of indigenous women in ‘women and environment’ literature and the aspect of gender in literature dealing with indigenous peoples natural resource management. It reviews empirical literature specifically dealing with indigenous women’s use and knowledge of natural resources, and the relationship between modernization, natural resource degradation and indigenous gender relations. The paper concludes that gender is indeed a relevant factor for understanding indigenous peoples’ natural resource management and therefore also critical to consider in relation to planned development and conservation. However, the question of gender equality and equity in relation to indigenous peoples’ natural resource management must be situated within the context of continued ethnic discrimination and indigenous peoples struggle for self determination. INTRODUCTION Indigenous women, like most poor rural women around the world, are, due to their dependency on the natural environment for sustenance and health, severely affected by environmental degradation and limited access to natural resources. Indigenous women are usually also disadvantaged regarding ownership of and access to land and to control over the resources they produce. Furthermore their ability to exert political influence and control over environmental decisions that affect their livelihood are often limited. Many of these problems indigenous women share with indigenous men, and the issue of gender has long been subordinated to the struggle for collective rights among indigenous peoples. However, it is generally assumed that women face discrimination and disadvantages on top of those faced by men due to unequal gender relations. 3', 'DIIS WORKING PAPER 2005/5 The organisations behind IGNARM share the impression that too little is still understood of the ways that indigenous gender relations affect and are affected by natural resource management and especially of the role of indigenous women in everyday natural resource management, and of the potential they have for securing sustainable development. The present working paper is intended to summarize existing knowledge and identify achievements and gaps in the understanding of the interplay of indigenous peoples, gender, and natural resource management based on a review of primarily academic and empirical literature. The paper is thus intended to serve as a background for IGNARMs further work and hopefully also as an inspiration for others sharing the same interest. DELIMITATION AND METHODOLOGY The assumption behind undertaking the present study was that indigenous men and women relate to and use natural resources in different ways, and that gender is an important aspect of indigenous peoples’ natural resource management. The literature study has shown that this assumption holds true to a large extent, but it would be premature to say that a review of existing literature on the subject makes it possible to reach a ‘state of the art’ conclusion as to how gender affects natural resource management among indigenous peoples, and how the ecological, legal, religious and cultural aspects of indigenous peoples’ natural resource management affect their gender relations. This is partly caused by the limitations of the study undertaken. Apart from the limited time available and the cultural heterogeneity of indigenous peoples1, the major problem has been that literature dealing with all three subjects is still limited2. Literature has been searched in the network organisations, in public Danish libraries and on the internet using keywords like indigenous/tribal/native, gender/women/woman/men, natural resource management/fishing/hunting/forestry/gathering/agriculture/water 1 According to a recent estimate, there are between 5 and 7000 different ethnic groups defined as indigenous peoples, living in various socio-economic and ecological conditions, and representing a unique cultural diversity (Hughes, 2003). As a consequence, the examples given in this paper can not represent all the varieties of indigenous peoples’ gender relations or their management of natural resources. 2 As an example, a search using the multiple keywords ‘indigenous peoples’, ‘natural resource management’ and ‘gender’ in the library at the Danish Centre of International Studies and Human Rights of which DIIS is part, which contains a huge collection on literature dealing with development and environmental issues gave zero hits. When substituting NRM with ‘environment’ the result amounted to 7 hits, whereof 4 were legal documents dealing separately with the three subjects. 4', \"DIIS WORKING PAPER 2005/5 management etc. A problem encountered using this method was that much literature about indigenous peoples is not given a keyword like indigenous peoples. Instead it is often classified under the geographical region, or name of the ethnic group. Likewise it has been found that some literature contains information on gender relations without having this as its main topic, which means that ‘gender’ is not used as a keyword. Consequently library searches have been supplemented with the ‘snowball method’, with the inherent risk of concentrating more on one field of research than on others. The review does not intend to cover the broad range of ethnographic literature on people who could be labelled indigenous. Rather it aims to discuss literature directly dealing with both gender and natural resource management among peoples identified as indigenous3. However, as the literature on all three aspects is still sparse, the review also includes literature that deals with only two of the three aspects of the subject as a means to contextualise the findings of indigenous men and women’s natural resource management. OUTLINE OF THE TEXT The paper starts by exploring how indigenous peoples and women respectively have come to be seen as central actors in natural resource management by providing a brief overview of some of the main discourses and theoretical positions of the relationship between gender and the environment on the one hand, and between indigenous peoples and nature on the other. It also explores the position of indigenous women in ‘women and environment’ literature and the aspect of gender in literature dealing with indigenous peoples natural resource management. Finally, it discusses the role of indigenous women’s struggle within the context of indigenous peoples' fight for collective rights and self-determination. The second part reviews empirical literature specifically dealing with indigenous women’s use and knowledge of natural resources, and the relationship between modernization, natural resource degradation and indigenous gender relations. Part three provides a discussion of the findings and points to some of the weaknesses in the present state of research and ways forward towards the genuine integration of gender, indigenous people and natural research management as the basis for and part of development interventions. 3 Indigenous peoples claim the rights to self-identification as indigenous peoples, but a common definition is that indigenous peoples are those peoples “which inhabited the country, or a geographical region to which the country belongs, at the time of conquest or colonisation or the establishment of present State boundaries and who, irrespective of their legal status, retain some or all of their own social, economic, cultural and political institutions” (ILO Convention (No. 169) concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries) http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/english/convdisp1.htm 5\", 'DIIS WORKING PAPER 2005\n",

Subsequently, all G7 members participated in the negotiation of the Paris Agreement in December 2015, and the New York signing ceremony in March 2016.3 The Paris Agreement and the 2015 G7 communiqué do not mention any particular fossil fuel, but the implication is clear: there is no future for unabated 4 coal power generation in a world that is acting to avoid dangerous climate change. Indeed, analyses point to the need for all OECD countries to have completed a coal phase out by 2030 if emissions reductions are to be on track.5 The G7 coal scorecard assesses country performance across three categories of action: 1. Is there a risk of new coal power plants being constructed? 2. Are existing coal power plants being retired? 3. Do country actions have a positive international impact? The first two domestic issues are analysed in respect to market drivers and government policies. The international impact of each country is then assessed by considering how private sector investments and government finance impact on coal power plants abroad. There are significant differences between the G7 countries in respect to the scale and relative importance of coal-fired electricity generation. This reflects the overall size of each economy and historical investment trends. The G7 coal scorecard tracks country performance across the three categories of action outlined above to enable meaningful comparisons of market dynamics and government policies irrespective of the significant differences in the scale of coal use in each country. In May 2016, the second edition of the scorecard reviewed the overall trends and looked at each country in detail. This third edition again updates the overall ranking while also providing an assessment of the situation in the USA and the initial impact of the new Trump Administration. 8 G 7 C O A L S C O R E C A R D – T H I R D E D I T I O N : R H E T O R I C V S R E A L I T Y I N T H E U S A', 'INTRODUCTION TO G7 COAL USE Capacity The differences in the scale of coal power plant capacity across G7 countries are illustrated in Figure 2. Four countries have relatively small amounts of coal capacity: France (3GW), Italy (9GW), Canada (10GW) and UK (14GW). Japan (44GW) and Germany (50GW) each have a power plant coal fleet larger than the sum of the four preceding countries. The USA has by far the largest coal power plant capacity, with its 276GW currently more than twice the size of the rest of the G7 combined. Figure 2: Size of the coal fleet in G7 countries, May 2017 Source: CoalSwarm Global Coal Plant Tracker, Sierra Club, E3G calculations Figure 2 also highlights the extent to which the current coal-fired capacity in each country is already scheduled for closure. As we discuss further below, France, the UK, and Canada have all made national political commitments to phase out all remaining coal power plants (by 2023, 2025, and 2030 respectively). This approach is also now being considered by Italy as part of the new national energy strategy. Currently 7% of existing capacity in Italy is scheduled to close in the coming years. In the remaining G7 countries, policy makers have yet to fully grasp the coal phase out challenge, although individual states and regions are starting to take the lead as market trends gather pace. In Germany, 12% of current capacity is already scheduled for closure, mainly in the period prior to 2023. The Federal government has 9 G 7 C O A L S C O R E C A R D – T H I R D E D I T I O N : R H E T O R I C V S R E A L I T Y I N T H E U S A', 'acknowledged that Germany’s climate plan implies that half of current coal capacity will need to have closed by 2030, although this is not yet a firm policy commitment. The city-region of Berlin has introduced its own coal phase out policy by 2030, with the Klingenberg lignite power plant being the first plant to close, in May 2017.6 The USA has already seen 67GW of coal-fired capacity close since 2010, while a further 49GW is scheduled to retire, equivalent to 18% of current capacity. These coming retirements alone are comparable in scale to the total coal fleet in Japan or Germany. The state of New York has moved to phase out its remaining coal plants by 2020, while Western States such as California and Oregon are acting to limit consumption of electricity from coal power plants from out-of-state. In Japan, just 0.8GW of capacity is set to close in the next decade. The debate in Japan lags behind the other G7 countries and is currently still focused on whether to build new coal, and does not yet consider the timescale for coal plant retirement. Generation During 2016, the UK saw a record low of just 9% of total electricity production from coal, contributing to an overall reduction of total UK CO 72 emissions of 6%. Just five years ago, coal contributed 40% of UK electricity, as shown in Figure 3. The USA also saw a continued fall in coal use in 2016, when it was overtaken by gas-fired generation for the first time. The trend in other countries remained flat year-on-year.

During this period 132GW of new coal plants have been proposed, mainly at the beginning of the decade. To date, however, just 32GW of new coal capacity has entered operation across the G7.8 More than double this amount of capacity has been cancelled by project developers, totaling 74GW (+7GW since May 2016). In Japan, there is currently 5.5GW of coal plant capacity currently under construction (+2.5GW since May 2016). Japan also has a substantial pipeline of new projects still under development, totaling 15GW. But even Japan has seen the significant cancellation of 2.2GW of proposed new capacity in the past 12 months, representing the first realization from market actors that coal is a bad bet.9 We can therefore reiterate our assessment from 2016: it is not too late for Japan to avoid locking itself into expensive stranded assets from new unabated coal power plants. In Germany, a 1.1GW coal plant is under construction which marks the last of an ill- fated wave of investments initiated prior to 2010. In the USA, three power plants with a combined capacity of 1.2GW nominally remain under development. We discuss the new coal development pipeline further below. Figure 4: G7 coal dynamics – cancellations and retirements Source: CoalSwarm Global Coal Plant Tracker, Kiko Network Japan Coal Map, Sierra Club, E3G analysis.

We are familiar with that term mainly from the 1980s, when acid rain led to the death of large tracts of Europe’s coniferous forests. But the phenomenon is in fact much older and occurred for the f irst time in Central and Eastern Europe in the nineteenth century. In the eighteenth century, Frederick the Great of Prussia had developed the concept of the modern state – a state involving itself in all facets of society. This also led to the idea of ‘f iscal forestry’, i.e. forestry intended to f ill the coffers of the state. Pursued systematically, this approach showed that some trees and some areas of forest produced higher yields than others. Birch and spruce, in particular, turned out to quickly yield a lot of timber, leading to the planting of large areas of production forest in Prussia. That was a success, and the approach spread to other parts of Europe. But what the ancient forests had never been able to teach the foresters became apparent in the nineteenth century. The emphasis on rapid production and the resulting monoculture led to the soil becoming exhausted and to Waldsterben, i.e. ‘forest dieback’ – the simultaneous death of large tracts of forest within only a short time. In his book Seeing like a State (1998), James Scott uses the example of f iscal forestry to show that when governments attempt to manage matters, they are doomed to simplif ication. (Scott, 1998) At f irst, such simplif ication appears to offer solely advantages, but in the long run things go wrong. Scott’s book – which is subtitled ‘How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed’ – otherwise mainly concerns large-scale modernist projects that we tend to see as being pursued by overambitious technocrats and governments blinded by ideology: Le Corbusier’s ville contemporaine, the Soviet collectivisation of agriculture, and the enforced creation of villages in African countries. That is a pity. The issue of how government can manage activities about which it actually knows too lit- tle is not only important for overambitious technocratic dictatorships. In the Dutch situation too, with a government that is by virtually all criteria normal, it is also relevant, certainly as regards science policy. After all, what does the government know about science? I know that after reading the above introduction there will be research- ers in the Netherlands who will instantly recognize my Prussian forestry', '88 BAReND vAN DeR MeuleN example as a metaphor for the country’s current system of science and scholarship. This system sees itself compelled by the ‘key economic sec- tors’ policy to focus on short-term economic yields (Valorisation! ‘From knowledge to skills to cash !’) and is slipping into a monoculture because of a lack of appreciation for the humanities and other supposedly economically useless knowledge. I myself don’t think things are really all that bad. Despite politicians and science administrators for thirty years now calling for more profiling, choices, ‘peaks in the delta’, focus areas and all the rest of it, the Netherlands, like other rich Western countries, has a broad portfolio of scientif ic and scholarly disciplines (Horlings and Van de Besselaar, 2012). The Ministry of Education, Culture and Science is the largest funder of research, and in its relationships with the Netherlands Organisation for Scientif ic Research (NWO), the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW), and the universities it still adheres to the principle of ‘managing at a distance’. There is no question of any ‘science dieback’ in the Netherlands (KNAW, 2015). The recurring question for the government, however, is how knowledge for specif ic purposes can be encouraged within the broad palette of Dutch science and scholarship. The ‘key economic sectors’ are the most recent example of this. At the end of the last century, the aim was to encourage emerging f ields such as biotechnology, materials science, microelectronics, nanotechnology, and catalysis. In the 1970s, when the Netherlands briefly had a separate Minister for Science Policy, there was a research policy for such areas as toxicology, soil science, and demography. And ten years before that, scientists had raised the question of how to choose between different investments if an end were to come to the almost exponential increase in the budget for science in the 1950s (Weinberg, 1962,). It was at about that time that some Dutch professors began to push for an explicit science policy, and the former Advisory Council for Science Policy (RAWB) was set up. The initial recommendations by the new council concerned, inter alia, participation in CERN, investment in space research, and the possibility of involving persons other than scientists when making choices in the scientif ic f ield (National Archive, 2008,). So there would seem to be nothing new under the sun. But over the years there has been a growing understanding of the relationship between government and science – including the essential tension that there is – and there has been successful science policy. And what seemed successful or promising has come to a stop again. Based on game theory insights into the relationship between government and science and past experience, I shall attempt to analyse what possibilities exist for managing research.', 'MANAGiNG WHAT cANNoT Be MANAGeD 89 Why have a science policy? Can government in fact manage scientif ic research? A legitimate counter- question is whether government should wish to do so. There are good rea- sons for leaving scientif ic research in the Netherlands to the free dynamics of science and the choices made by researchers, certainly if the value of knowledge is in itself a suff icient reason to fund research. But governments do not invest in science only in order to know – they also want to win. And knowledge is a powerful weapon. The US federal budget for research has its origins, inter alia, in the American Civil War, the Second World War, and the signif icantly named ‘War on Cancer’. The European research budget received a powerful boost in the 1990s when Japanese companies, with the support of their government, were winning the technological race in microelectronics. European companies such as Philips and Siemens sought and found support for additional investment at European level. And in our own country the ever-present threat of water is still always a good reason to have a world-renowned technological institute in this f ield, as well as research programmes, and several clusters of questions on the quality, management, and use of water in the Dutch National Research Agenda. In 1963, the then Minister of Education, Arts and Sciences, Theo Bot, defended the concept of science policy as follows: Science has come to occupy a central place in modern Western society, and there is virtually no sector of contemporary society in which it does not exert its influence to a greater or lesser extent. [...] At the same time, scientif ic research demands ever greater f inancial and human resources. Both these developments have led to science no longer being a matter for scientists in general, but a matter of general interest. [...] We cannot do without a deliberate policy. (Handelingen, 1963-64, pp. 729-731) The Minister went on to note that science policy must also recognize the value of ‘free research that is not aimed at increasing the standard of living’, must create the right conditions for such research, and must ensure that it does not focus too narrowly on the natural and technological sciences. Those are arguments that resonate into the present century. The Minister also added immediately that it [is] still too early to predict the solutions to which the reassessment of the Dutch organisation for science policy, which has now commenced, will ultimately lead. Every country, including the Netherlands, will need', '90 BAReND vAN DeR MeuleN to develop its own institutional and procedural solutions [...] It is not possible to indicate general rules for this [...]. And that brings us back to the core of the problem. Government wishes to pursue policy, and have good reasons for it, but how it should do so is often unclear. Knowledge for sale The question regarding ‘managing science’ can probably best be answered if we start from the simple idea that government must make choices and then ensure that we become the best in the fields it has chosen. And for those who do not wish to leave matters entirely to the government, ‘the Netherlands Ltd’ should make the choices and we should become the best in those f ields. There is a lot that can be said against such an approach. But the idea of making choices as the core of science policy is a constant theme of advisory reports, policy papers, and discussion contributions about science policy. That makes it at least a useful starting point for an essay on the issue of managing science. To put it in a rather less commercial manner: science is important for the welfare of society and the economy (as was forestry in Prussia). It is therefore an object of state concern, and the state must ensure that Dutch scientists carry out – or are able to carry out – the research that the country needs, and above all the research that the country really needs. This creates a relationship between government and scientists that goes beyond the former patronage relationships in which powerful administrators or rich patrons gave artists and scientists the scope to engage in the arts and science. A factor that should make it easier for government to make choices is that there is a f inancial relationship between government and researcher. This offers the possibility of a contract between the two parties. However, that contract concerns ‘knowledge’ and is therefore different to a contract by which government buys a new logo, commissions a new t\n",

I read with some surprise EB Maple’s letter (see FE 370, Fall 2005) regarding an article I wrote which was published in the Winter 2005 issue of the Fifth Estate. Maple writes: “The standard issue primitivism of the article’s message appeals to me in many ways...” Thanks, a rather condescending way to agree with some aspects of my vision, but an acknowledgment nevertheless. But then Maple adds: “Still, a call for the creation of organically self- organized subsistence movements that are aimed at asserting access to land doesn’t seem particularly feasible for too many people when we're talking about an increasingly urbanizing trend across the world.” I believe anarchists and other rebels need to encourage each other to keep trying. Eventually some of us will have successes and a momentum will be created which will be on our side. And remember, land based peoples everywhere are counting on us to begin listening and learning. But then, perhaps Maple and I don’t agree on what we are aiming for, because s/he also states: “I ...wonder what a revolution would really look like; how much of the old industrial, citified world will we bring into the new one?” Civilization didn’t colonize everywhere at once, nor did it reach its current strength immediately, so its undoing might occur to different degrees and at different places at different times. In this respect, a modern-primitive synthesis might take hold in some areas should coercive Te My Dearest Fifth Estate... LETTERS authority there be destroyed (or wither away?), but hopefully Maple agrees with me that any amount of the “old industrial, citified world” would obviously be out of place in a truly “new one”. Maple’s question “Besides, can tens of millions move to the countryside?” was very misleading. I didn’t suggest anywhere that tens of millions of people should get up tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and head out to the countryside. Most ecologists recognize that urban life is unsustainable and damaging to human (and many other life forms) health. A healthy person lives in a healthy habitat. A city is not a healthy habitat. Somehow all of us need to be fighting for and dreaming of and moving toward non-urban lives. Not tens of millions EB, but six billion!

Why stick with the possible, with politics why stay within the parameters defined by the ruling ideology? It is time to shed feelings of waiting and defeatism. How do situations, how do things change? When people have had enough. Ya Basta. Haven't you had enough? “We are reminded that the city as polis created not only politics, but the police.” That is from a David Watson article. I add: We are reminded that the city as a walled sewage system created not only dead rivers—but civilization.

We are not trying to instruct others on how they should conduct themselves in their personal or collective lives. Rather, we feel it is important to explore the anti-authoritarian ideals we often project onto society from the inside of our communities and lives. It doesn’t take an anthropologist or a great theorist to realize that people thrive in situations where love, sharing, and mutual aid prevail as opposed to what constitutes the current monstrosity in which we live where ruthless competition, violence, fear, and rage are the norm. Early societies manifested the former qualities as a matter of necessity; their survival depended upon mutuality. However, in the modern world, the permanent mobilization of fear is the basis for sustaining the state and the economy; this fear has roots deep in the first state societies. While people once lived in harmony as an integral part of nature, now they live in fear of the wild, of outsiders, of newly constructed punitive sky gods, of the power of women, of those below one in the social hierarchy. Fear was then transformed into a rage against all that was threatening. Security came with surrender to the rulers and the supreme Ruler, complete with a military and productive apparatus. ‘The political state depends on an infantilizing mass character structure of submission. Mass acquiescence feeds the myth of the state’s necessity. But for all that the rigid global order may deliver to some in material terms and even through its twisted spiritual institutions, the state’s destructive impact on our collective psyche and the planet’s body becomes more painfully obvious each day. In Eric Fromm’s instructive 1955 text, The Sane Society, he asked what if the definitions of modern society were applied to an individual; how would we judge that person? A homicidal, egoistical, psychopath was the answer. His conclusions for solving our common human dilemma was to establish what he called communitarian socialism—anarchism—which reinstalls those principles and emotions that nurtured our species through its first million or so years. We agree, but what do we do while waiting for and hastening the revolution, and what if there isn't one in our lifetime? How do we navigate an increasingly frightening and destructive world that seems clearly headed in the opposite direction from what we desire? How do we maintain emotional and planetary health? Some of the tentative solutions implied in these pages are obviously incomplete, only part of the story. But some of the most personal and local venues for liberation suggested—such as love and intimacy, laughter and erotic play—get close to the root of what we value and why we fight against alienation. Sexual and emotional repression convey the core of how so many people get skewed and fragmented, abused and hurt in this society. Our fourth issue of 2005—our fortieth anniversary year—is published late in December, hence it is labeled as Winter 2006, so as to not have it appear almost immediately out of date. With this late-breaking edition, we have completed four consecutive years of consistently producing four issues a year, quite an accomplishment after publishing sporadically for much of the 1990s— and not at all in the year 2001. : Also, this issue was produced solely in Tennessee by our small “bolo bonobo” production collective at the Pumpkin Hollow community, where the Barn and our mail-order book distro is based. For our Spring 2006 edition, production duties will return to the Detroit group, and we will continue to alternate responsibilities in this manner into the indefinite future. While we are still evolving and working out the finer details of our new editorial arrangements, emerging is a new arrangement where the two geographically-based collectives within the larger collective will work cooperatively and autonomously. The discerning reader will probably notice some changes, especially between the personality of issues produced in different locales. We’ll do our best to provide quality art, writing, and provocative content—wherever the issue is finally edited and designed.

            "['11 Medicare: The making and consolidation of an Australian institution Anne-marie Boxall A popular and entrenched institution Medicare, the foundation of Australia’s universal healthcare system, has been in place for nearly 35 years. It has hardly changed during that time. Medicare’s main objective was to ensure all citizens had access to affordable basic health care. Its core features came on line fairly quickly. Universal entitlement to subsidies for medical services came into effect from 1 February 1984 after the Hawke Government passed legislation to establish a medical benefits scheme. Free treatment in public hospitals was also guaranteed because the Commonwealth had already successfully negotiated funding agreements with the states and territories. While public support for Medicare was fragile in the leadup to its introduction, its popularity has grown over time. Medicare is now widely considered to be one of the country’s greatest policy achievements—or, in the words of a 2014 opinion piece: ‘[I]f a popularity contest was staged for Australian government programs Medicare would walk into the final’ (Wade 2014). 257', 'SuCCESSFuL PuBLIC POLICy Data to substantiate this claim came from a 2011 Essential Poll, in which respondents were asked their views on some of the most significant Commonwealth Government policy decisions over several decades. Medicare received overwhelming support, with almost 80 per cent of people saying it was good or very good. Approval of Medicare rated far higher than either the floating of the Australian dollar or free-trade agreements (Wade 2014). In the most recent iteration of this poll, published in 2016, the proportion of people who agreed that Medicare was good for the country had fallen to 56 per cent, but it was still ranked as the second most popular government initiative (compulsory superannuation was ranked first) (Essential Research 2016). Medicare’s popularity does have a downside. The public is now so fond of Medicare that it is difficult for governments to make any changes to it at all. The Coalition Government discovered this when it proposed a $7 co-payment for a visit to a general practitioner (GP) in the 2014–15 Budget (Department of the Treasury 2014). The government said the change was needed to ensure the growing costs of health services were sustainable and argued that the move demonstrated its commitment to Medicare long into the future (Department of the Treasury 2014). The public did not buy it and the controversial proposal was eventually dropped. In 2016, the Coalition was reminded how much the public loved Medicare when it suggested that the back-end payment systems might need modernising (Glance 2016a). The government proposed a taskforce to investigate the options, but one of them was to have private companies run the Medicare payment system (Glance 2016b). The Labor opposition seized on the idea, characterising it as the ‘privatisation of the Medicare system’, ‘the thin end of the wedge’ and the beginning of the Coalition’s attempt to savage ‘bulk billing and eliminate universal healthcare in this country’ (Shorten 2016). Despite widespread criticism of Labor’s tactics, the ‘Mediscare’ campaign, as it became known, was effective. It gave Labor a significant boost in the polls and forced the Coalition to spend the rest of the campaign publicly defending its commitment to Medicare (Muller 2017). The Coalition eventually won the election, but by only one seat (AEC 2016). It now seems that even the most peripheral, behind-the-scenes changes to Medicare carry substantial political risks for governments. 258', '11 . MEDICARE Context: Medicare’s tumultuous trajectory Because support for Medicare is now so strong, it is hard to imagine it was ever a contentious policy, but it was. The ALP first proposed a universal health insurance scheme in July 1968. In the following years, public opinion on the relative merits of universal health insurance and private health insurance fluctuated widely (Grant 2000: 261). When the Whitlam Labor Government eventually implemented universal health care in 1975—in a scheme called Medibank—public support for it was fragile. The majority of people polled said they preferred Medibank over private insurance, but a large proportion of people were undecided (Grant 2000: 261). The medical profession was far from undecided. Large sections of the medical community vehemently opposed Medibank. The peak medical body, the Australian Medical Association (AMA), mounted a massive campaign designed to stop the introduction of Medibank. It led to a legislative stalemate that was resolved only after a double-dissolution election and the first (and only) joint sitting of parliament, in 1974. After Medibank eventually became law, it was another year before the Whitlam Government could convince all the states and territories to sign up to Medibank (their cooperation was needed to implement the hospital side of Medibank). Medibank was finally up and running across the country by October 1975. Just weeks later, the Whitlam Government was dismissed (Boxall and Gillespie 2013). When the Fraser-led Coalition Government was elected in December 1975, it promised to maintain Medibank, despite years of opposing the scheme in public and in parliament. Fraser (1976) explained away his policy backflip by stating: Look, time marches on. Circumstances change and you deal with circumstances as they are. Medibank was introduced. Amongst many people it was plainly popular. It would have been destructive and unreasonable to attempt to break Medibank. Fraser did not keep his promise once in government. Within six months of coming to power, the government began modifying Medibank. After a series of major changes designed to find a way of balancing Medibank with private health insurance, in 1981, the Fraser Government decided to 259', 'SuCCESSFuL PuBLIC POLICy abolish Medibank. Australia was left with a system of voluntary private insurance and the shame of being the only advanced economy to have dismantled a universal healthcare system (Boxall and Gillespie 2013). Fortunately, Australia’s health reform journey did not end there. When the Hawke Labor Government came to power in 1983, it began making plans to implement Medicare—a virtual carbon-copy of Medibank. Public support for universal health care waxed and waned during the Fraser years, but polls taken in 1983 and 1984 showed the majority of people were in favour of Medicare. As time went on, the number of people undecided about the merits of Medicare fell and support for it continued to grow (Grant 2000: 264). Some powerful segments of the medical profession (medical specialists in particular) were still strongly opposed to Medicare, but they were in the minority. The Coalition, however, was still dead against it. In 1983, when Labor was preparing to implement Medicare, opposition health spokesman Jim Carlton threatened to abandon it as soon as the Coalition was reelected (Blewett 1983: 410). The Coalition was still threatening to dismantle Medicare almost a decade after it was fully implemented. In opposition in 1987, John Howard reportedly said Medicare had ‘raped the poor of this country’ and he would stab Medicare in the stomach if the Liberals regained office (O’Connor 2003; Elliott 2006). The Coalition did not fully accept Medicare until 1995. Like Fraser before him, Howard (1995) explained that his party had changed its mind on Medicare because Australians wanted to keep it. It had become clear to the Coalition that there would be serious electoral consequences for opposing Medicare. Data from the Australian Electoral Study over time highlight the point. In five of the six election surveys conducted after 1990, respondents ranked Labor higher than the Coalition on health issues. According to analyst Richard Grant, this can be explained in part by perceptions that Labor would spend more on health, but the results also reflected the public’s strong preference for retaining Medicare. Grant argues that the margin between the parties was greatest in 1993 when voters were still uncertain about the Coalition’s commitment to Medicare (Boxall and Gillespie 2013: 156–7). Since 1995, both sides of politics have been competing to demonstrate their commitment to Medicare, with both claiming to be its principal advocate and protector (Boxall and Gillespie 2013). 260', '11 . MEDICARE Agenda-setting: Getting Medicare (back up) The Hawke Labor Government was elected on 6 March 1983 when Australia was in the midst of the worst economic recession for 50 years. Inflation was high, at about 11 per cent, and unemployment had skyrocketed from 5.5 to 9.9 per cent between March 1982 and March 1983 (ABS n.d., 1983). Despite this, the Hawke Government managed to implement Medicare on 1 February 1984, less than a year after coming to power. This was possible only because Medicare had been an integral part of Hawke’s key election pitch to introduce the Prices and Incomes Accord. The accord was an agreement on economic reform, negotiated in 1982 between the ALP, while in opposition, and the powerful Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). The accord’s main aim was reviving the economy, creating new jobs and establishing the conditions for strong economic growth into the future. To succeed, however, the accord had to find a way of preventing an explosion in wage growth once the economy began to recover. Labor’s plan was to get the unions to cooperate and agree to accept a return to centralised wage fixing and refrain from making any additional wage claims (except in extraordinary circumstances) (Kelly 1992: 61–2). As a former ACTU leader, Hawke knew the unions would demand something in return for their cooperation on wage restraint—for example, better social welfare. He also knew the impact social welfare reforms would have on the Budget; Medibank, Whitlam’s universal health insurance scheme, cost $1.6 billion in its first year\n",

            "['CHAPTER THREE Background: Scan of the Literature on Effects of Payment Models on Physician Practice Overview A variety of forces, including increasing health care costs and the passage of the Patient Protec- tion and Affordable Care Act (ACA), have led providers and payers (both private and public sector) to experiment increasingly with payment models other than simple FFS. These expand- ing models include global payments, shared savings (e.g., ACOs), physician–hospital gain- sharing, episode-based payments, PFP, and subscription or retainer arrangements and are fre- quently coupled with new practice organizational forms, such as medical homes and ACOs (Schneider, Hussey, and Schnyer, 2011). However, the ways in which practices respond and adapt to these payment models, creating their ultimate effects on individual physicians and allied health professionals, is unclear. Similarly, the extent to which these currently expanding payment models motivate physician practices to change their business strategies (e.g., by merg- ing with each other or affiliating with hospitals) is unknown. Two prior, long-running studies have been particularly notable for their focus on payment models and organizational characteristics of physician practices. The first is the National Study of Physician Organizations (NSPO), a series of three surveys of physician practice administra- tive leaders conducted in 2000–2001, 2006–2007, and 2011–2012. In the past decade, the NSPO has contributed valuable insights on the prevalence and relationships between payment models, structural capabilities, and other practice characteristics in the United States (Rob- inson, Shortell, Li, et al., 2004). However, the NSPO has not collected data from individual physicians working within the surveyed practices that would allow description of relation- ships between payment models, physician work content, and other aspects of the patient care experience. The second major study was the Community Tracking Study (CTS) Physician Survey (CTS-PS) and Health Tracking Physician Survey (HTPS), conducted by the Center for Study- ing Health System Change. The CTS and HTPS surveyed physicians in five waves (with some design modifications over time) between 1997 and 2008. The community-level component of the CTS collected qualitative data from a diverse set of 12 health care markets in the United States between 1997 and 2010, establishing a valuable baseline for understanding the evolu- tion of these markets (and, by extrapolation, the U.S. health care system more broadly) leading up to the expansion of newer payment and organizational models, such as ACOs and medical homes. However, the CTS and HTPS have not surveyed physicians since 2008, and the study will not be repeated by the Center for Studying Health System Change, which merged with Mathematica Policy Research at the end of 2013. 9', '10 Effects of Health Care Payment Models on Physician Practice in the United States In addition to these two major studies, recent evaluations of novel commercial payment models, such as the Alternative Quality Contract of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, have focused on effects on patient care (finding, for example, that, under shared savings, prac- tices have redirected referrals to lower-cost settings) but have not assessed physician work expe- rience or practice financial sustainability (Mechanic, Santos, et al., 2011). Although evaluations of new Medicare payment pilots are under way, to our knowledge, there are no current efforts to describe the scope of new payment models promulgated by pri- vate payers or to investigate how physician practices are responding to simultaneous, poten- tially conflicting payment models from private and public payers. Therefore, there is an unmet need to describe the effects that current combinations of rapidly changing private and public payment models are having on physicians’ practices, professional lives, and delivery of patient care—and to explore how these effects are modified by market context. Payment Models Included in the Scan In this section, we define the key types of payment models covered in this literature scan, using the project’s conceptual model as a framework. We include the following categories of payment models. First, three “underlying” payment models can exist alone, without other types of pay- ment: FFS, capitation, and episode-based payment. Second, we include PFP and shared savings as “supplementary” payment models that can coexist with one or more underlying payment models (but cannot exist on their own without underlying payment models). Third, we include retainer-based payment models as variations of capitation in which the patient typically pays a fee in exchange for access to a physician practice. With the exception of retainer-based practices, we do not investigate the role of copay- ments, deductibles, or other payments that patients could be required to make to physician practices. Though patients’ direct payment responsibilities could affect physician practices in many ways, this aspect of benefit design (which can coexist with any underlying payment model) is outside the scope of this report. Fee for Service In simple FFS payment models, the basis of payment is per service unit, usually following service unit descriptions in the CPT codes. For a given provider, the rate of payment is a flat rate per service unit; i.e., all services of a given type are paid the same piece rate. Other design details could vary considerably, with different entry requirements and shares of payment for which patients are responsible (e.g., deductibles and copayment amounts). Typically, practices are paid on a rolling basis, after billing for each service unit they provide to patients. In theory, there is no role of chance in calculating FFS payment amounts: As soon as an FFS contract is signed, the amount of payment for a given service unit can be known with certainty (although practices can still be uncertain about payment amounts when FFS contracts lack clear and complete payment information). Capitation In capitation models, the basis of payment is per patient per time period, with the time period typically being one month. To decide which patients are included for a given physician prac- tice, attribution rules must be applied. In managed care plans, a common attribution rule', 'Background: Scan of the Literature on Effects of Payment Models on Physician Practice 11 would be to attribute a patient to a primary care physician when the patient explicitly identifies to the payer his or her choice of primary care physician. When patients do not identify their physicians, other attribution rules can be applied, ranging from “contact capitation” for sub- specialists (in which seeing a patient once results in a capitation payment for services in that subspecialty) to more-complex attribution rules, such as those based on providing the plurality or majority of qualifying services. For a given attributed patient, capitation models can include all services the patient receives during the contracted time period or only a subset of these ser- vices (e.g., a primary care practice could have a capitation contract that covers only the profes- sional fees for primary care services). The rate of payment could vary based on patient charac- teristics, such as age, sex, and health status, typically with higher rates for patients whose care is expected to be more expensive during the time period of the contract. The rate of payment might or might not be intended to fully cover patients’ expected costs of care. Other design details can vary. Notably, in concept, payment can occur at any time fol- lowing patient attribution; it is not necessary to wait until the end of the time period of the contract. For example, practices in a yearlong capitation contract might be paid for each patient on a monthly basis. In pure capitation, there is no role of chance in the amount of payment per patient per time period: As soon as a capitation contract is signed, the amount of payment for a given patient per time period is known with certainty. Of course, physician practices receiving capi- tation payments could be taking considerable financial risks—but the random component is confined to the costs of delivering care (which is distinct from the amount of payment received). On the other hand, if capitation contracts include risk-sharing, in which the physi- cian practice is partially insured by the health plan against unexpectedly high costs of care, the amount of payment could be partially determined by random variation but in a way that reduces a practice’s financial risk. Episode-Based and Bundled Payments As their name implies, episode-based payment models use episodes of care as the bases of pay- ment. Episodes can be defined in multiple ways, typically according to a set of diagnoses and services provided over a specified time frame. For example, an episode of care could include an inpatient hospital stay plus all services provided during a window surrounding the inpatient stay. When episode-based payments cover the services of multiple providers involved in the episode, such as different physician specialties, hospital care, and post–acute care, these pay- ment models are called bundled payments. For a given episode type, the rate of payment can be flat or variable—but because the intent of such models is to give physician practices an incen- tive to contain the costs of care, the rate of payment typically does not increase if costs of care are higher. Payment can occur before, during, or after an episode of care. As with capitation, the role of chance in episode-based payment models can vary. The amount of payment per episode can be prespecified in a contract (leaving no random compo- nent) or include risk-sharing to insure the practice against very high episode costs (resulting in random variation in the payment amount). Also as with capitati\n",

            "['Chapter Seven. Other Official Medical Fee Schedule Issues In this chapter, we discuss fee-schedule issues that are not directly related to how the prices are determined under the RBRVS. The issues include allowances for PADs, allowances for nonprofessional services provided by hospitals and ASCs that are currently covered by the OMFS for physician services, guidelines and edits for correct coding and documentation, and opportunities to introduce pay-for-performance (P4P) incentives into the fee schedule. Physician-Administered Drugs Background California WC pays for outpatient pharmaceuticals dispensed to patients, as well as pharmaceuticals administered directly to patients by physicians. PADs are injected or infused in the office setting and include low-cost generic drugs, high-cost specialty drugs of biologic origin, and immunizations. Our discussion focuses primarily on different payment options for PAD materials. It also covers payment for injection services related to PADs. We do not address physician-dispensed repackaged or compounded drugs. WC currently applies the OMFS pharmaceutical formula to set allowable fees for therapeutic or diagnostic PADs.45 Fees for brand-name and generic pharmaceuticals are set at average wholesale price (AWP) plus 10 or 40 percent, respectively.46 Providers are expected to report the NDC when they bill for PADs. But providers often bill using HCPCS J-codes that group comparable PADs into a single code. Because NDCs have AWPs, the allowances for the therapeutic and diagnostic PADs are regularly updated when providers bill NDCs. We do not know how WC J-code–allowed fees are priced, and the allowances may be outdated. There is no additional dispensing fee for PADs, but practitioners can bill a separate injection service code (90700–90799) when injecting drugs. There are also separate codes for infusion procedure– related PADs. WC uses a different system to determine allowable fees for most immunizations. The OMFS has RVUs for certain immunizations (including the injection fee), while others are BR. The BR allowance is the acquisition cost of the immunization plus a $14.30 injection fee.47 The CPT 45 The specific OMFS language is as follows: “Pharmaceutical injection materials administered during therapeutic, diagnostic, or antibiotic injections are separately reimbursable using the Pharmaceutical Formula. A dispensing fee is not allowable with these injections.” 46 AWP is a metric published by third-party data aggregates using industry-reported transaction prices. 47 This policy applies to CPT codes 90725–90749 and 90710–90711. Practitioners must submit an invoice for the vaccine product. The $15 injection fee was discounted 5 percent under SB 228 (2003) and remains discounted. 77', 'codes used to describe the immunizations and the RVUs are outdated. For most other drugs that are not PADs (including physician-dispensed drugs), the OMFS adopts Medi-Cal’s allowable fees, which are generally equal to 83 percent of AWP. There are significant differences between the current OMFS approach to PAD allowances and Medicare’s approach. CMS uses HCPCS J-codes rather than NDCs for drugs and biologicals. CPT codes describe immunizations and vaccines (most of which are not covered by Medicare). In 2003, CMS transitioned from an AWP-based payment system to an average sales price (ASP)–based system because of uncertainty surrounding the accuracy and applicability of AWP estimates. Under the old policy, practitioners were paid AWP minus 5 percent for PADs. Practitioners are currently paid ASP, a more robust and reliable estimate of acquisition cost, plus 6 percent for PADs. Several classes of PADs—including blood and blood products other than clotting factors, infusion drugs administered via DME, and immunizations48—are exempt from the new ASP-based policy and continue to be paid at 95 percent of AWP. Currently, the reimbursement rate for PADs under Medi-Cal is equal to the Medicare Part B reimbursement rate for drugs, biologicals, and vaccines when available and published by CMS, currently defined as ASP plus 6 percent.49 If a CMS rate is not available, the pharmacy rate of reimbursement applies. The pharmacy rate is defined as the lower of (1) AWP minus 17 percent, (2) the federal upper limit, or (3) the maximum allowable ingredient costs. Providers are instructed to report the NDC paired with the appropriate HCPCS J-code except for vaccines, for which the NDC is not required.50 The prices listed under Medi-Cal rates for PADs include a one- time injection-administration fee of $4.46 for injections and immunizations.51 Other state WC programs follow three general approaches (Table 7.1). Like California, some states (e.g., Michigan, Oregon, Tennessee, and Washington) set PAD-allowable fees at AWP times a multiple (from 0.835 to 1). California uniquely adds a significant margin (10 and 40 percent for brand and generic drugs, respectively) on top of AWP. Texas pays a multiple (125 percent) of Texas Medicaid rates, which follow the Medicare ASP-plus-6-percent approach. Ohio leaves PAD payment decisions to managed-care contractors. 48 Only influenza, pneumococcal, and hepatitis B vaccines are covered by Medicare. Payment rates for these vaccines are established annually based on the AWP methodology. 49 The medical-services provider manual outlining PAD billing and reimbursement is at California Department of Health Care Services, undated. 50 The NDC is required because physician-administered drugs other than vaccines are subject to the drug rebate program. The NDC is also needed to price drugs that do not have a Medicare price. Crosswalks are available to link NDCs to J-codes. 51 The injection fee is applied only once for the first billed unit of the drug and is subtracted from the published rate for additional units. 78', 'Table 7.1 Payment Approaches Related to Physician-Administered Drugs Payer PAD Material Fees Administration Fees Immunization Provisions California OMFS AWP + 10 or 40% for brand Injection codes billable RVUs (including injection fee) for and generic drugs, alongside E&M services most immunizations.

Physicians purchase PADs from manufacturers and wholesalers, and, when they administer a drug, they keep the difference between the amount paid by insurers and what they paid to acquire the drug. In one approach, payers use a price benchmark to approximate the prices at which physicians buy drugs. Payers use benchmarks to avoid significantly under- or overestimating physicians’ costs. Physicians might increase utilization if payment is much higher than acquisition cost or not provide PADs at all if payment is much lower than acquisition cost. One particular benchmark— AWP—was widely used by payers, including Medicare and state Medicaid programs, in the early 2000s and continues to be used as a benchmark by some payers. Estimates of AWP were published by aggregators of industry-reported data. But because pharmaceutical transactions often involve proprietary rebates, volume discounts, and other adjustments, these industry-reported amounts do not necessarily reflect final prices paid by purchasers.

            "['Future Sea Level Rise Scenarios and the Shoreline of Mar del Plata, Argentina: Assessing Socioeconomic Impacts and Relief Measures Introduction The coast of much of the Americas is threatened by global sea level rise (SLR), and the problem is attracting the attention of researchers around the world (Feagin et al. 2005). In order to effectively assess risks, coastal cities are using models to simulate the scenarios proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It is estimated that 1.2 billion people, or approximately 23 percent of the world’s population, live within 100 meters of sea level and at 100 km. from a coast and are thus vulnerable to sea level rise (Cooper et al. 2005). A global review of the population and urban settlement in Low Elevation Coastal Zones (LECZ), that is. the contiguous area along the coast that is less than 10 meters above sea level, found that it covers 2 percent of the world’s land area but contains 10 percent of the world’s population and 13 percent of the world’s urban population (McCranahan et al. 2007). The IPCC suggested a rise of 0.09 to 0.88 meters by the year 2100 unless greenhouse gas emissions are reduced substantially (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2001). More recent studies indicate that the melting of ice sheets could be faster and hence more challenging for society (Overpeck et al. 2006). Current ice discharge data show that melting ice may cause a sea level rise of 1 to 3 meters by 2100. New data on rates of deglaciation in Greenland and Antarctica suggest greater impacts from glacial melt, and a possible revision of the upper-bound estimate for SLR in this century. A World Bank Research Working Paper (Dasgupta et al. 2007) cites numerous authors including Ringot and Kanagaratnam (2006), Hanna et al. (2005), and Krabill et al. (2004) who concur with the finding that the contribution of the Greenland ice sheet to SLR is roughly double the rate assumed in the IPCC Third Assessment report. Other investigations indicate that a collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet would raise average sea level by approximately 5 to 6 meters (Dasgupta et al. 2007, citing Tol et al. 2006). Similarly, Velicogna and Wahr (2006) the ice sheet in Antarctica is decreasing faster than the IPCC suggests. Dasgupta et al. (2007) add broader perspectives to the SLR problem by modeling new informa- tion. Their research on precautionary planning suggests that a SLR in the range of 1 to 3 meters should be regarded as realistic. Their models were calculated using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and satellite images (SRTM 90 m) for SLR scenarios ranging from 1 to 5 meters. The spatial distribution of the impacts of climate change will not be uniform. Some regional changes in climate are expected to be much more pronounced than changes in the global average and others less so (CBO 2005). Besides SLR, it is well established that climate-change-induced risks will affect human health in a variety of ways and will more than double by the year 2030 (Patz et al. 2005). Although no model is capable of capturing the whole range of the SLR impacts, they provide the basic first steps toward mitigating such impacts. For example, flood risk can be mitigated at low Page 1', 'cost through risk-based development planning. Such initiatives use new flood maps and amended building codes to address climate change. The future costs of reducing climate change can also be addressed by taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and this must also continue to be a major global focus. Reduction in greenhouse gases, however, will slow the effects of climate change over the coming century, not prevent or reverse them. At the very least, such reduction will buy time to implement the necessary adaptation to protect society from the effects of climate change (Herweijer et al. 2008). Insurers can play an important role together with policymakers to disseminate information on the risks, especially in fast growing coastal cities. Cities that engage in coastal management efforts should take into account nonstructural approaches, such as beach nourishment, dune construction and stabilization as well structural initiatives (Herweijer et al. 2008). However, misinformation is still widespread. Based on the differing interpretations of the same knowledge base, there are the “optimists” who argued that human adaptation will reduce the magnitude of the impacts to a level where SLR becomes almost a trivial problem. This argument seems a modified version of the idea that pollution is not a major problem because at some point in the future humanity will have the resources to eliminate it. Meanwhile, “pessimists” argue that SLR and climate change in general are a major threat for the twenty-first century (Nicholls and Toll 2006). In addressing climate change, researchers and policymakers face various sources of uncertainty. There are still hurdles to be overcome before it is possible to conduct comprehensive impact and response analyses including: incomplete knowledge of the relevant processes affected by SLR and their interactions; insufficient data on existing conditions; difficulty in developing the local and regional scenarios of future change; and lack of appropriate analytical methodologies to assess some the impacts (Nicholls and Nimura 1998). Although the most traumatic consequence of SLR is permanent flooding, there are several other visible processes that ought to be considered, such as coastal erosion, episodic flooding from storm surges and salinization of aquifers, and these, in some aspects, require more urgent attention. Erosion caused by climate change will affect two of the core functions of beaches, namely tourism and coastal defense. The risk SLP negative affecting the tourism industry is high in the eastern and southern Caribbean and along the east coast of Brazil, but also in some areas of Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, and Peru (CEPAL 2010). The uncertainty and complexity associated with climate change tends to produce conflicting information. Argentina is a case in point. Vafeidis et al. (2011) indicates that the land surface in low coastal areas is 3,463 square km, housing a total population of 3.8 million in 2000, projected to rise to 5.1 million in 2030 and 5.8 million in 2060. The same research calculates the number of people exposed to SLR in Argentina to be about 725 thousand in 2000, projected to increase to about 763 thousand by 2030 (10 cm SLR scenario) and 804 thousand by 2060 (21 cm SLR scenario). This study uses different types of satellite images to establish the different SLR projections. Similarly, the UN-Habitat Urban Global Observatory identifies Mar del Plata as one of the coastal cities in Argentina, among others, that is at risk due to SLR (figure 1). In contrast, Dasgupta et al. (2007) suggests that the area, the population, and the gross domestic product (GDP) of Argentina will not be significantly impacted by SLR. Page 2', 'Figure 1. Latin America and Caribbean Cities at Risk Due to Sea Level Rise Source: Modified from UN-Habitat Global Urban Observatory, 2008 A European research points out that in the low-lying coastal regions and estuaries in Argentina and Uruguay, an increase in sea level could reduce biological diversity and the surface of coast, damaging infrastructure and leading to saltwater intrusion into aquifers, estuaries, and wetlands (Europe Aid 2009). The same studies indicates that if SLP were to block the flow of rivers on the plains towards the ocean, the risk of flooding could increase in these basins Mar del Plata with 616,142 inhabitants is the seventh largest city of the Republic of Argentina and the head of the Municipality of General Pueyrredon and is located 400 km south of Buenos Aires. The city faces the Atlantic Ocean and has an important role in the argentine tourism industry. Tourism is one main economic activities of Mar del Plata, receiving millions of visitors during the summer season. The city also harbors the most active fishing port of the country. Tourism and recreation continue to grow at fast-pace encouraging human settlement developments along the shoreline. As a coastal city, Mar del Plata faces several of the problems Page 3', 'associated with SLR. Some research has been conducted in relation to the erosion of its shoreline. Alvarez and Ferrante (2000) quantified the coastal erosion in Mar del Plata during the period 1970–1998 and determined significant coastal retreat values of the shoreline. Similar results were found for other smaller cities in the province of Buenos Aires, such as Quequen and Necochea. However, to our knowledge, no prior research has simulated the scenarios described by the IPCC or by Dasgupta et al. (2007) for Mar del Plata. This study proposes to develop models that consider different sea level increases for the shoreline of Mar del Plata building upon the scenarios suggested by the IPCC, which are: a low rise scenario (0.09 m by 2100), a moderate rise scenario (0.48 m by 2100), and a high rise scenario (0.88 m by 2100). We also model other hypotheses that anticipate a more drastic increase estimated at 1 m, 2 m, and 3 m by 2100, following the World Bank Research Working Paper (Dasgupta et al. 2007). The overlaying of the resulting maps with socioeconomic data could provide answers for the central questions of this study, namely: Where will coastal damage take place and to what extent its effects will vary spatially? What is the present socioeconomic context of the sectors of the city that are vulnerable to the sea rising scenarios? What are the relief measures that can be implemented in the short and long terms?

A baseline scenario and a climate change (CC) scenario were simulated for both assets. Table 2 provides a description of the baseline and CC scenarios, and the additional sensitivity scenarios simulated for Stephenfield Reservoir and Pelly’s Lake. Table 2. Overview of assumptions by scenario Scenario Description Baseline A business-as-usual (BAU) scenario that assumes the continuation of historical trends such as water extraction and population growth. There are no climate change impacts assumed in the baseline. CC The CC scenario assumes an increase in precipitation variability and a shift in precipitation patterns. Sensitivity scenarios Stephenfield Reservoir: • O&M irrigation: two assumptions on the cost of operations of irrigation infrastructure, low (CAD 24/ha/year) and high (CAD 150/ha/year). • Conventional (5 per cent/year) and low (2.5 per cent/year) discount rates for the value of asset services. A low discount rate results in a higher medium- to long-term value for the ecosystem services provided by the asset. Pelly’s Lake: • Ecosystem services: high case and low case for the provision of ecosystem services (i.e., cattail production) from wetland and lake. The assumptions used are: - Cattail yield, low (15 tonnes/ha/year) and high (18 tonnes/ha/year) (based on Grosshans et al., 2011). - Nitrogen (N) removal from wetland, low (350 kg N/ha/year) and high (32,000 kg N/ha/year) (based on Berry et al., 2017; Olewiler, 2004; Wilson, 2008). - Phosphorus (P) removal from wetland, low (80 kg P/ha/year) and high (770 kg P/ha/year) (based on Berry et al., 2017; Olewiler, 2004). - P removal from cattail, low (20 kg P/ha/year) and high (60 kg P/ha/year) (based on Berry et al., 2017; Grosshans et al., 2014). • Conventional (5 per cent/year) and low (2.5 per cent/year) discount rates for the value of asset services. A low discount rate results in a higher medium- to long-term value for the ecosystem services provided by the asset. The low discount rate scenario is referred to as Low DR ES; see Section 5 of this report. IISD.org 13\", \"An Application of the Sustainable Asset Valuation (SAVi) Methodology to Pelly's Lake and Stephenfield Reservoir, Manitoba, Canada Monetary results are presented in two forms: discounted (or net present value) or undiscounted. Discounting is applied to consider the value of future investments, today. In fact, the net present value represents how much the investment is worth in today's money, considering the potential cost of financing, inflation and more. A higher discount rate assumes that money will be worth less in the future. A low discount rate assumes instead that the value of the investment will be higher in the future. In the context of ecosystem services, there is a long-lasting debate on whether the discount factor should be large or small, or even negative. Climate assumptions The model includes precipitation (long-term trend and short-term variability) by month (North American Regional Reanalysis, n.d.) (Annex I), to capture impacts of changing seasonality on asset costs and benefits between 2019 and 2050. The CC scenario assumes for both assets an annual increase of 0.5 per cent in precipitation variability and a change in precipitation patterns. According to the Prairie Climate Centre (2018), precipitation in Manitoba is projected to increase during spring, autumn and winter months, and decrease during the summer months. This change in precipitation patterns is captured by applying a multiplier that increases the share of precipitation during the winter months by 10 per cent and decreases it by 10 per cent during the summer months. The change in precipitation is assumed to occur linearly between 2019 and 2050. The seasonal distribution of precipitation for the years 2045 to 2050 is illustrated in Figure 5. The CC scenario (blue line) shows an increase in the share of precipitation at the beginning and end of the year and a reduction during the summer (peak precipitation) months. Changes in precipitation could result in changes in required water supply from irrigation and flood risk (reservoir overflow), as well as fertilizer use. 0.2 0.15 0.1 0.05 0 2045 2046 2047 2048 2049 2050 Climate change Baseline Figure 5. Distribution of seasonal precipitation by scenario (2045–2050) Assumptions on infrastructure costs and valuation of asset services The replacement cost of asset services is based on the current level of service(s) provided (e.g., nutrient removal) and the corresponding required capacity of built infrastructure (e.g., water treatment plants) to provide the same level of service. The cost of built infrastructure is discounted at a 5 per cent rate (or 2.5 per cent in the low discount rate scenario) starting from 2019. Table 3 presents the cost assumptions for each of the infrastructure components.

The SAVi Wastewater model is, on the other hand, equipped with three different wastewater treatment technologies (physical removal, ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis) and is parametrized based on Iglesias, Ortega, Batanero and Quintas (2010). The standard values used in the SAVi Wastewater model are consistent with cost assumptions used in the SAVi Canada assessment. The N removal efficiency of the different treatment methods is assumed to be 70 per cent for physical removal, 80 per cent for ultrafiltration and 95 per cent for reverse osmosis, respectively. 2 This assessment considers the marginal cost of irrigation per hectare. The model is calibrated to match the values reported by Samarawickrema and Kulshreshtha (2009), and have been determined by dividing the cumulative O&M cost of irrigation by the total cumulative water use per hectare. 3 The carbon sequestration cost is estimated based on the cost of reducing emissions (carbon mitigation) using wind power. This is a technology-based comparator, but the carbon tax could also be used. In the case of wind, we have considered an average emission rate of 1 tonne of carbon dioxide per MWh for coal and zero for wind (IEA, 2017). We then considered a cost of CAD 1 million per MW of capacity (IEA, 2014), and 23 per cent use factor. The cost per tonne of carbon dioxide avoided is, as a result, CAD 25 per tonne.

The assessment does not compare or contrast the two assets. Each valuation should be viewed separately. The assets demonstrate that nature-based infrastructure can deliver a range of services in a much more cost-effective manner than built grey infrastructure. The SAVi assessments also calculate the capital and operating costs that taxpayers would need to face if governments were to build grey infrastructure to provide the same services provided by Stephenfield Reservoir and Pelly’s Lake.

In most cases, this table lists agencies and major suborganiza- tions (such as subagencies) along with the Web site of interest for the major program, office, or initiative. However, in some cases, we go below the major program, office, or initiative level because of the diversity in federal agencies, their activities and data, and its relevance to critical sites.

            "['6 Health City In 2012 I stood on the fourth floor of the Shija Private Hospital in Langol Lamkahi. On the other side of the road running past the hospital and all the way along the foothills to the National Games Village – completed to house athletes for the 1999 event and then sold off, in controversial fashion, in the years following – is a church built on a hillock, a cluster of houses on various flattened patches of hill, and at street level a row of restaurants and small hotels. A small sign marking the start of the ‘reserved forest’ is lost among the advertisements for Palmei Fooding and Lodging, Triune Medicos, and scores of small signs advertising various training courses and tutors to help students pass medical examinations. As I stared out the window a bus full of young women in yellow and purple nursing uniforms passed on its way to the hospital’s own nursing college. At night, while much of Imphal is in darkness and the hills of Langol are speckled with small house lights, Shija glows from the lights generated by its own power supply. The site has been dubbed ‘Health City’; a phrase that even the Chief Minister has begun to use. The domed main building stands out in the landscape of Langol – its ref lective glass visible against the backdrop of the hills. Branching out from the main building are a series of single-storey clinics and specialist centres, offering everything from obstetrics, to cosmetic surgery (specialis- ing in rhinoplasty and blepharoplasty), to cardiology. Along the walkway connecting these clinics is a huge board listing the names of all the doctors who practice in these clinics, and in the wards and their hours. Almost all of them are from Manipur. This is signif icant given the brain drain out of the region usually creates the opposite scenario. Part of the car park is given over to the hospital’s own ambulance service. At the rear of the compound is a new blood bank and transfusion centre funded through MDONER and the NEC, the Indian Government’s special ministry and coordinating agency to orchestrate development of the region. The blood bank is the only one of its kind in the borderland. In mid-2013, on one of many visits to Shija, I toured the blood bank with the hospital’s public relations off icer. I was telling him how impressed I was by the technology on display in the facility. He mentioned that the blood supply to Shija from the public hospital was unreliable, so they needed to secure their own supply. He paused and said, ‘We need a reliable supply of blood because a lot of people get shot here’. This chapter is concerned with the endogenous liberalisation of the health sector in Imphal. The boom in private healthcare has been dubbed ‘health', '146 BorderlaNd CIt y IN New INdIa city’, referring to the concentration of high-quality private health facilities in the city. This poses an obvious and somewhat compelling question: What explains world-class health facilities in such a tumultuous polity? The dire condition of the public sector, Manipur’s high number of health profession- als, the availability of (once) cheap land on the outskirts of the city, and the injection of capital from so-called silent partners all play their part. Demand from patients in Myanmar and other parts of the borderland is also a factor. This has produced alternative ways of enabling movement mobility across the border for patients that bypass Indian authorities. However, the private health sector is also an expression of self-suff iciency, of what can be achieved independently of the Indian state and the civilian government in Manipur. For a polity where the desire to reinstate sovereignty lost in 1949 has been a power determinant of the present conjuncture, the private health sector is a model of what can be achieved if the people of Manipur are left to their own devices. In a context where state-led development reflects neo-colonial occupation, self-suff iciency is a powerful symbol of both lost autonomy and future capacity – yet future capacity is almost always imagined as an autonomous state. Imphal’s booming health sector is private by necessity, not desire. The boom in private healthcare has also transformed the landscape on the northwestern edge of the city created new battles over land between settlers who moved into the peri-urban fringe in the 1990s escaping conflict and a new class of medical and other professionals seeking land and entrepreneurs seeking to build new facilities. I begin with a discussion of health liberalisation in India and an account of a different path to liberalisation in Imphal. The second section focuses on the decaying public system and the emergence of an irresistible narrative about the benefits of the private health system; narratives supported by the quality of the facilities, care, and treatment experienced by patients. The third section returns to the puzzle of a world-class transnational health hub in the disturbed city. I argue that the health sector reflects a pragmatic response to state dysfunction and a kind of accidental liberalisation par- ticular to Imphal. The chapter closes with an account of the ways the health city has pushed the boundaries of Imphal to the northwest, transforming the previously ambiguous zone around Langol into legible urban space. Building a Health City Throughout India there have been major changes to the provision of health- care following liberalisation in the 1990s. As Selvaraj and Karan demonstrate', 'HealtH CIt y 147 (2009), health insecurity has increased in India since liberalisation in the wake of escalating healthcare costs for inpatients and outpatients, user fees for public facilities, patients being asked to procure their own medicines, the ascendency of the private sector in medical education, and in the train- ing retention of personnel, and a growing urban-rural divide in access to healthcare. This increases the costs of healthcare on patients and their family members, increases household debt, and influences decisions on whether to seek treatment in the f irst place. The Indian Government has responded with various measures, including a health insurance scheme targeting families below the poverty line, the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY) launched in 2008, and the National Rural Health Mission, launched in 2005, that increases availability of essential healthcare in rural and remote areas. Critics argue that these schemes further enable liberalisation of the health sector as they push patients towards private health providers without signif icantly reducing f inancial risk for the poor (Selvaraj and Karan, 2012; Vellakkal and Ebrahim, 2013). In a study of RSBY in the state of Maharashtra, Ghosh (2014) critiques the role of commercial insurance companies suggesting they are ill suited and uninterested in advocating for uptake of the scheme. Parallel research into the National Rural Health Mission suggests that it has fallen short of its targets but that it has put accessible public health and health equity on the political agenda (Balarajan et al., 2011; Husain, 2011). Exploring the diverse and often contradictory f indings from this research is beyond the scope of this chapter; the point here is that in the broader narrative of ‘new’ India, health is perceived as an opportunity to improve eff iciency and delivery by proponents of liberalisation, and an example of both the weakening of the state and the capacity of the state to enable further expansion of the private sector. The borderland has been specif ically targeted for improved health provi- sion. Manipur and other Northeast states were identif ied as ‘focus states’ by the National Rural Health Mission, entitling them to higher per capita funding through the scheme. Manipur has many positive health indicators. It has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in India at 30 deaths per 1000 live births, which is signif icantly lower than the national average of 57 deaths (MHFW, 2009: 12). A total of 87% of women receive antenatal care, 83% from a doctor (MHFW, 2009: 12). Child nutrition indicators are also strong. Only 23.8% of the population under three years old is reported to be underweight, which is less than half the national average (45.9%) and among the top three in India (Planning Commission India, 2007: 157). On the flip side the HIV/AIDS rate is estimated to be the highest in India (MHFW, 2009:', '148 BorderlaNd CIt y IN New INdIa 23), tuberculosis rates are the second highest in India (MHFW, 2009: 24), and levels of sexual and physical violence are among the highest in India (MHFW, 2009: 28; see also McDuie-Ra, 2012c). Manipur’s health sector is characterised by low uptake of funds. This can be seen in the gap between funds allocated and actual expenditure on public health (Berman and Ahuja, 2008: 213). Where these funds go is unclear, yet given the extent of corruption and the opaque nature of governance it can be assumed that they are absorbed at various points along the way. Annual regional health reports by the National Rural Health Mission note chronic shortages of staff in the hill areas – especially Tamenglong, Ukhrul and Chandel – though the situation is better in the regional towns in the valley, where there is a surplus of staff in certain health f ields (NRHM, 2010; 2011; 2012). The health scenario in Imphal is almost the reverse of areas outside the capital. There are f ive comprehensive hospitals (two public and three pri- vate) as well as scores of clinics, many advertising themselves as hospitals, specialist centres and diagnostic centres. Of these, Shija Hospital in the north of Imphal embodies the endogenous and pragmatic liberalisation of the health sector, and has extended the boundaries of Imphal. And it is at Shija where the juxtaposition between the health city and the disturbed city is most profoundly felt. My meeting with Dr Singh, one of the founders of Shija Hospital, in mid- 2013 began with mutual recognition\n",

            "['', 'Preface The Health Systems in Transition (HiT) profiles are country-based reports that provide a detailed description of a health system and of reform and policy initiatives in progress or under development in a specific country. Each profile is produced by country experts in collaboration with an international editor. In order to facilitate comparisons between countries, the profiles are based on a template, which is revised periodically. The template provides detailed guidelines and specific questions, definitions and examples needed to compile a profile. A HiT seeks to provide relevant information to support policy-makers and analysis in the development of health systems. This can be used: • to learn in detail about different approaches to the organization, financing and delivery of health services and the role of the main actors in health systems; • to describe the institutional framework, process, content and implementation of health care reform programmes; • to highlight challenges and areas that require more in-depth analysis; • to provide a tool for the dissemination of information on health systems and the exchange of experiences between policy-makers and analysts in different countries implementing reform strategies; and • to assist other researchers in more in-depth comparative health policy analysis. Compiling the profiles poses a number of methodological problems. In many countries, there is relatively little information available on the health system and the impact of reforms. Because of the lack of a uniform data source, quantitative data on health services in Myanmar are based on a number of sources – the World Health Organization, United Nations Children’s Fund, The World Bank, Asian Development Bank, Central Statistical Office of the Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development, Myanmar Information Management Unit website, and other relevant sources considered applicable to Myanmar’s context. viii', 'The HiT profiles can be used to inform policy-makers about the experiences in other countries that may be relevant to their own national situation. They can also be used to inform comparative analyses of health systems. This series is an ongoing initiative and material is updated at regular intervals. In-between the complete renewals of a HiT, the APO has put in place a mechanism to update sections of the published HiTs, which are called the “Living HiTs” series. This approach of regularly updating a country’s HiT ensures its continued relevance to the member countries of the region. Comments and suggestions for the further development and improvement of the HiT series are most welcome and can be sent to apobservatory@wpro.who.int. HiT profiles and HiT summaries for Asia Pacific countries are available on the Observatory’s website at http://www. wpro.who.int/asia_pacific_observatory/en/. ix', '6 Principal health reforms Chapter summary Expansion of the health system, with the networks of public hospitals, rural and urban health centres, and sub-rural health centres, was most vibrant between the 1970s and 1990s. The health system can also be judged by its success stories: eradication of smallpox, elimination of leprosy, trachoma, poliomyelitis and iodine-deficiency disorders. The first in the series of reforms implemented since the 1990s was on improved access to essential medicines and the introduction of different financing mechanisms to recover and replenish the costs. Reforms in other health-financing mechanisms were added (e.g. Revolving Drug Fund, hospital trust funds, community cost sharing including exemption for the poor, and community donations) in all public hospitals. Some of these financing mechanisms continue today. Initially, these mechanisms aimed at ensuring continuous replenishment of essential medicines by mobilizing resources from households and communities in the face of insufficient government funding. Later the mechanisms were extended by introducing exemption for the poor and supporting them through other mechanisms like trust funds, to offer protection from financial risk. However, these interventions are not able to raise sufficient revenues to replenish the medicines, or to reduce the out- of-pocket expenses and financial burden of the poor. The work of the RHCs since the early 1970s has been focused on externally assisted programmes, concentrated in selected townships and only for specific programme priorities, such as tuberculosis, malaria and HIV, and reproductive health. Thus, those townships without any donor-supported programmes had to concentrate on their routine activities with little technical, financial or material support. With the low salary paid to health workers, the staff in these areas became off-hour private practitioners. Major improvements in the health status of the population are crucial for inclusive growth. Public budget allocation for health has increased considerably in the last few years. However, no relevant data are available on how much of this increase has resulted in significant improvement in equity and access to health services. Donor-coordination and fund-support mechanisms have evolved into integrated programme management with the principle of 135', 'Oneness in line with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, but more effort is needed. The challenges of Myanmar are to overcome the limitations of the past (e.g. low investment in rural health services), inadequate funding for expansion of universal health coverage, and possible use for health of the funds generated from revenue on extracting natural resources. New opportunities should also be explored for filling the fiscal spaces in the national budget, and for increasing investment in rural health facilities. 6.1 Analysis of recent reforms Since the 1950s, the health system of Myanmar has expanded, creating networks of public hospitals, rural and urban health centres, and sub- rural health centres throughout the country. Most of this growth occurred between the 1970s and 1990s, when Myanmar adopted the principles and strategies of Health for All (HFA) and primary health care (PHC), following the Alma Ata Declaration. This community-based policy had a great impact on health development, especially in the prevention and control of major communicable diseases, and reducing child and maternal mortality. Health development in Myanmar could also be judged from its success stories, such as eradication of smallpox, elimination of leprosy, trachoma, poliomyelitis, and iodine-deficiency disorders (Ko-Ko, Thaung & Soe-Aung, 2002). Myanmar received international recognition for its achievement in health development during the 1980s and 1990s. For example, the Ayadaw Township People’s Health Plan Committee received the Sasakawa Health Prize at the 39th World Health Assembly in May 1986 (Tin-U et al., 1988). The Township Committee executed a successful health development programme using HFA and PHC, with the aim of total socioeconomic development in Ayadaw, within a short period. The township has maintained its momentum of health and development (Than-Sein, 2012). The Department of Health (DOH) received the International LIGURIA Prize for technology development in health and nutrition for the Joint Nutrition Support Programme (JNSP) of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) in 1991 (WHO, 1992). The JNSP in Myanmar demonstrated that, despite lack of resources, improvement in child health and nutrition through PHC could be brought about for a large population over a short period of time and at low cost per capita. A few of health reforms started in the 1980s and 1990s, during the period of the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) and State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) (see section 2.1), had great impact on health status, access to services and widening health inequity.

Universal health coverage (UHC) is currently at the centre of global policy debate. Since the 58th World Health Assembly that endorsed UHC (World Health Organization, 2005), and the 2010 World Health Report, which recognized the critical role of health system financing (World Health Organization, 2010), many low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) are considering reform of their healthcare financing systems to offer better financial protection and access to needed healthcare for all. A country’s decision on how to transform its health financing system should not only be guided by decisions on revenue collection and fund pooling but also on healthcare purchasing (World Health Organization, 2005, Carrin et al., 2008). In the health system, purchasing refers to the process by which funds are transferred to healthcare providers to obtain health services for the population. Purchasing can be strategic or passive (World Health Organization, 2000): strategic purchasing involves the on-going search for the best means to optimize health systems performance by deciding which interventions should be purchased, how they should be purchased and from what providers, while passive purchasing occurs by following a pre-determined budget or simply paying bills when presented (World Health Organization, 2010). Strategic purchasing can improve health systems performance by promoting quality, efficiency, equity and responsiveness of healthcare service provision and, in so doing, facilitate progress towards UHC (World Health Organization, 2010, Figueras et al., 2005). Despite the important role that purchasing plays in health systems performance, there is very limited empirical work on purchasing arrangements in LMICs. The RESYST (Resilient and Responsive Health Systems) consortium, in collaboration with the Asia Pacific Observatory on Health Systems and Policies (APO), undertook a multi-country study to critically examine how purchasing mechanisms are functioning in a range of LMICs from a strategic purchasing perspective; and contribute to filling gaps in the literature relating to purchasing arrangements. 3', 'What is strategic purchasing? Purchasing involves making three sets of decisions: (1) identifying the interventions or services to be purchased while taking into account population needs, national health priorities and cost-effectiveness of those interventions; (2) selecting service providers, giving consideration to service quality, efficiency and equity; and (3) determining how services will be purchased, including contractual arrangements and provider payment mechanisms. A critical factor in health systems performance is the extent to which purchasers are able to influence providers to pursue equity, efficiency and quality in health service delivery (RESYST, 2014). In strategic purchasing, a purchaser is an organization that buys health services, using pooled funds, for certain groups or the entire population. The purchaser can use levers to influence the behavior of providers to improve quality and efficiency in health service provision and facilitate equity in the distribution of healthcare providers. However, purchasing mechanisms operate within each country’s policy framework and, in strategic purchasing, government is required to play a stewardship role by providing a clear policy framework and appropriate guidance to ensure that resource allocation and purchasing decisions are linked to public health priorities. As the purchaser buys health services for people, it is important for the purchaser to ensure that there are effective mechanisms in place to determine and reflect people’s needs, preferences and values in purchasing, and hold healthcare providers accountable to the people. The key strategic purchasing actions are shown in Figure 1. 4', '‘Strategic Purchasing’ – definition and analytical framework used in the multi-country study Fig.1. Key strategic purchasing actions in relation to purchaser, providers, Government and citizens • Select providers considering range, • Protect against fraud and quality, location corruption • Establish service arrangements • Pay providers regularly • Develop formularies and standard • Allocate resources equitably across treatment guidelines areas • Establish payment rates • Establish and monitor user payment • Secure information on services policies provided • Develop, manage and use • Audit provider claims information systems • Monitor performance and act on poor performance HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS PURCHASER GOVERNMENT CITIZENS • Establish clear frameworks for • Assess population needs, purchaser and providers preferences and values • Fill service delivery infrastructure • Inform the population of their gaps entitlements and obligations • Ensure adequate resources • Ensure access to services mobilised to meet service • Establish mechanisms to receive entitlements and respond to complaints and • Ensure accountability of feedback purchasers • Publicly report on use of resources and performance Source: Authors’ summary The analytical framework used in the multi-country purchasing study To understand the various components of strategic purchasing and the organizational environment within which they operate, the study employed the multiple principal-agent relationship model suggested by Figueras et al. (2005), which provides a framework for examining relationships between different actors. 5', 'An agency relationship refers to one in which a person or organization (the agent) acts on behalf of another (the principal). The principal has objectives that they want to accomplish and delegates tasks to agents in order to achieve these objectives. If both the principal and the agent seek to maximize their own utility or benefits, there is good reason to believe that they may have divergent objectives and that the agent will not always act in the best interests of the principal (Pratt and Zeckhauser, 1985). The challenge facing the principal is in creating institutional arrangements for the agent so that the agent’s best interests, given those arrangements, lead to desirable outcomes for the principal. Institutions refer to rules, laws, norms and customs to which an organization is subject (Ben-Ner and Putterman, 1998), and govern the way in which organizations can cooperate and/or compete (Williamson, 1996). In strategic purchasing, the multiple principal-agent framework can be used to define the relationships between: (1) purchasers and providers, (2) government and purchasers, and (3) citizens and purchasers: • For purchasers and providers: In the principal-agent relationship, the purchaser, as principal, uses financial, contractual, regulatory and monitoring mechanisms as levers to ensure that the health provider, as its agent, delivers an appropriate mix of quality healthcare services, at an agreed price. In this relationship, it is important to consider: (i) the criteria used to select providers; (ii) the form of contract that is employed; (iii) the mechanisms by which providers are paid; (iv) how prices are set, and whether prices are affordable and realistic; and (v) the mechanisms put in place to monitor performance. The organizational environment in which providers operate (e.g. the number of purchasers and healthcare providers, etc.) and the internal management systems they use for operation are also critical. • For the government and purchasers: In this principal-agent relationship, the purchaser acts as an agent for the government (principal). The government must play a stewardship role to ensure that public health priorities are linked to resource allocation and purchasing decisions. In 6', '‘Strategic Purchasing’ – definition and analytical framework used in the multi-country study the context of purchasing, three defined stewardship tasks exist: (i) formulation of health policy to define the vision and direction of the health system; (ii) exertion of influence, including approaches to regulation of the health sector; and (iii) collection and use of intelligence to monitor health system performance. • For citizens and purchasers: A principal-agent relationship exists between the citizen (the principal) and the purchaser, who acts as the citizens’ agent in purchasing healthcare services. A key question in this relationship concerns the extent to which the purchaser represents the needs, preferences and priorities of citizens when determining service entitlements; and monitoring mechanisms for ensuring quality, equity and responsiveness in health service provision (Figueras et al., 2005). The framework applied to this study is limited to principal-agent relationships that directly involve purchasers. While a number of other principal-agent relationships exist in healthcare financing mechanisms and these may also provide valuable insight into purchaser performance, this study focuses on the roles and functions of purchasers in their relationships with providers, Government and citizens as purchasers undertake strategic purchasing. Figure 2 presents an outline of the principal-agent relationships in strategic purchasing and serves as the conceptual framework for the study. Fig.2.

            "['Conclusion In India, states play a critical role in shaping and implementing health care policies and priorities. States organize, deliver, and increasingly direct funding for health services. For organizations looking to achieve broad impact, engaging directly with states can be crucial to securing funding, infrastructure, and opportunities to scale. Yet partnering with states can be challenging. Due to bureaucratic, administrative, and political complexities, state support is often unpredictable and difficult to navigate. In this report, we highlighted lessons learned from a range of institutions that successfully dealt with these challenges. Though their approaches differed, several common trends emerged: ▪ Most importantly, successful organizations spent considerable time identifying and engaging the right government officials. ▪ Securing buy-in is foundational for success but is a lengthy process, often requiring months or years of continuous outreach. ▪ To develop a compelling sell, organizations aligned their pitch to state officials’ needs or priorities. ▪ Organizations frequently pilot an initiative—shouldering the upfront cost—to validate their product. ▪ Lastly, to blunt the effects of inconsistent or delayed funding, organizations turned to innovative approaches, including codifying their activities in state health budgets, diversifying their customer base, or finding alternative public-sector funding. While none of these approaches guarantee success, they reflect field-tested practices that may offer practical guidance for organizations looking to partner with Indian states.

Stakeholders pointed to complex bureaucratic, political, and administrative processes as top factors hampering partnerships. As Figure 1 depicts, health care governance in India is hierarchical and bifurcated between the national and state governments. Though the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is responsible for health policy, regulation and oversight is dispersed across many governing institutions, often with overlapping remit. This has created a compartmentalized and fragmented system, leaving stakeholders unclear on which departments and officials to approach. The center-state balance can also be difficult to reconcile. During our interviews, a few state health agencies noted that forging international partnerships required the assent of the central government, while other states did not indicate such assent was required. As one stakeholder described, the public sector feels like a “massive opaque structure.” Some states, such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, recognize these challenges and are designing integrated public health projects that cut across different verticals. These reforms are promising but may be slow to materialize. In the meantime, be prepared to seek many layers of approval across various governmental entities to move a project forward. Identify and continuously engage the right national institutions. For instance, at the national level, the Department of Biotechnology and the Department of Science and Technology (both under the Ministry of Science and Technology) can serve as important supporters of new technologies. One Indian enterprise advised staying in contact with these entities during product development, particularly as they are willing to support innovative startups. “If the individual has the vision, it Target the right state- and district-level officials. It is critical to have support can be rolled out quickly. If they get from the principal secretary of Health transferred, then the next person may and the director of the National Health not have the vision” Mission in any state of operation. However, the intricacies of the approval – from an interviewee and implementation process will differ from state to state. Approval from a senior-level official is a necessary step, but a lower-level technocrat will ultimately be charged with implementation.

However, be aware that new projects are an additional duty for them. To reduce their workload burden, identify areas of alignment between new projects and current responsibilities. Find a well-connected advocate with institutional knowledge. Stakeholders emphasized the importance of partnering with individuals, officials, or institutions who can navigate the political and bureaucratic system and identify, access, and effectively communicate with appropriate government officials.

Retrofits are also an effective tool for economic recovery because they create a high number of jobs per dollar invested (8–27 jobs/$ million6), employ a range of skilled labour, use mostly local materials, and create employment where people live. 1 Government of British Columbia, Building BC’s Recovery, Together (2020), 7. https://engage.gov.bc.ca/app/uploads/sites/608/2020/06/Recovery-Discussion-Paper.pdf 2 Building BC’s Recovery, Together, 9. 3 Ibid.,9. 4 OECD, Building Back Better: A Sustainable, Resilient Recovery after COVID-19 (2020), 2. http://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/policy-responses/building-back-better-a-sustainable-resilient-recovery-after- covid-19-52b869f5/ 5 Ellen Macarthur Foundation, A Solution to Build Back Better: Circular Economy (2020). https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/assets/downloads/emf-joint-statement.pdf 6 Dunsky Energy Consulting, The Economic Impact of Improved Energy Efficiency in Canada (Clean Energy Canada, 2018). https://cleanenergycanada.org/wp- content/uploads/2018/05/TechnicalReport_EnergyEfficiency_20180403_FINAL.pdf; and Acadia Center, Energy Efficiency: Engine of Economic Growth in Canada (2014). http://acadiacenter.org/document/energy-efficiency-engine- of-economic-growth-in-canada/', 'The B.C. government is soliciting feedback on the $1.5 billion Economic Recovery Fund. The following document outlines the Pembina Institute’s recommendations for investing in building retrofits through the Economic Recovery Fund and Budget 2021.7 Challenges There are some challenges in successfully delivering both rapid economic recovery and lasting social benefits through retrofits: • Existing incentives and regulations focus primarily on energy efficiency and carbon reductions: interaction with resiliency and health objectives are often ignored at the planning and design stage or not implemented because they are not incentivized (see Figure 1 and 2). • Public subsidies for retrofits can deepen inequity issues if mostly directed to those who own property. • Many individual owners must be informed and understand the value of upgrading their property despite uncertain economic times. • Access to trained contractors and high-performance equipment is limited, and creates a bottleneck. • Short-term incentives can create a boom-bust cycle in the demand for retrofits and ultimately slow market transformation.8 7 The recommendations presented in this document were informed by discussions with experts from industry, public service organizations, and local government.

When these incentives were cancelled or fully allocated the retrofit industry saw a sharp decline. The upcoming stimulus funding is an opportunity to rebuild the renovation sector sustainably by combining incentives and workforce development with regulatory measures to sustain the retrofit economy beyond this stimulus period. Pembina Institute Accelerating B.C.’s economic recovery through building retrofits | 2', 'Guiding principles To address these challenges, we recommend that stimulus investments in the building sector be guided by the following five key principles. • Integrate public health and climate objectives for low-carbon resilience: Ensure major retrofits capture opportunities to improve seismic resiliency, climate adaptation, and disease control alongside carbon reductions (Figure 1 and 2). • Target funding to increase equity: Focus incentives on renters, low-income homeowners, and public assets serving the needs of communities: long-term care facilities, affordable housing, schools, and Indigenous housing. • Go deep, rather than wide: Maximize opportunities for carbon and energy reductions at each site, rather than attempt to reach many sites with low-cost measures. This will help support the construction sector and grow upstream economic development in manufacturing of high-performance components and materials. • Build the workforce: Partner with public and private organizations to deliver subsidized training programs, develop design guides, conduct integrated design sessions (charrettes), create data tools (e.g. remote energy audits), etc. Provide retraining support for impacted economic sectors to join the retrofit economy workforce. • Pair short-term incentives with policy measures to sustain long-term action: Clarify the objectives of the 2024 retrofit code and accelerate consultation for its design, firm up timelines for performance standards for heating equipment, move forward with mandatory disclosure policies, and enact PACE-enabling legislation.

            "['India’s Energy Transition 4.0 Taxing Energy Production: The role of fiscal policy in promoting sustainable energy The analysis suggests that tax system changes can have unintended consequences by shifting relative preferences between electricity generated by coal and solar technologies. This raises a wider set of questions about the extent to which India’s fiscal system is aligned with the country’s energy policy objectives. There are three areas where improvements might be made: setting the tax rate so that it captures the value of negative external costs; the most efficient use of subsidies for social purposes; and the promotion of sustainable energy. As regards external costs, it is well recognized that coal use in thermal power plants imposes a major cost on society. The combustion and transport of coal contributes to local air and water pollution by the release of fine particulates, mercury, sulphur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) (Munawer, 2018). Public health impacts include increased incidence of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. The health benefits from avoiding such emissions are estimated to be INR 9,62,222 crore (USD 134.7 billion) by 2030 (Srinavasan et al., 2018). Coal power is also a major contributor to climate change through the release of CO2 emissions. Under the previous tax system, coal was subject to the Clean Environment Cess of INR 400 (USD 6) per ton, as a means to tax the externalities caused by its use. This has now been replaced with the GST Compensation Cess, at the same rate. It is not clear, however, to what extent this tax rate captures the health and environmental costs arising from the use of coal. Ideally, the tax rate should be based on an evaluation of the full costs of coal—including both local air and water pollution and climate change costs—and estimate of the tax rate that would maximize overall welfare for society. As regards social purposes, it is important to note that a higher tax rate on coal could increase the average cost of electricity and have a negative impact on economically vulnerable groups. An evaluation of the full costs of coal should also consider how different tax rates would affect vulnerable groups and 10', 'their access to energy. If necessary, complementary policies could be designed to ensure that any tax rate contributes to India’s energy policy and health policy objectives at the same time as protecting the poor. For example, targeted subsidies could be used to ensure that low-income consumers can afford energy, or more robust social assistance policies could be used to reduce living costs in other areas. This might include measures that flexibly top up household incomes, such as cash transfers; or measures intended to reduce costs for specific societally valuable needs, such as healthcare and education. As regards sustainable energy, it is sensible for the tax system to help encourage investments that are likely to lead to sustainable social “goods,” particularly when more fundamental corrective measures such as broad- based carbon taxation are not likely in the short- to medium-term. The introduction of the GST has resulted in the removal of certain exemptions and increases in the tax on cost components such as PV modules, which increases the cost of generation for solar PV. To some extent, this may reflect the fact that grid-scale solar is increasingly cost-competitive compared to coal power, and, as a result, short-term subsidies intended to incubate a new technology can be phased out. The Economic Survey 2018, for example, has already suggested a reconsideration of incentives to reduce the scale of subsidy support to the renewable energy sector (Ministry of Finance, 2018a). At the same time, ongoing debate about the need for solar power to now meet stringent cost ceilings, and the dampening effect this is having on auctions, suggests that this optimism may be premature—and, again, ought to be subject to a full evaluation. There are still some large impediments to realizing India’s renewable energy targets. For example, by 2022, 40 GW of rooftop solar capacity is targeted for installation, but its uptake has been lacklustre, as it is still prohibitively expensive for homeowners who enjoy subsidized electricity. Similarly, distributed solar, microgrids and small-scale renewable energy are segments of the renewable energy sector that require market structures that drive early deployment to bring down costs by developing more efficient business models, consumer bases and technological development. Likewise, offshore wind, floating- solar and other nascent renewable technologies will not be able to compete without appropriate market mechanisms until they mature as part of India’s renewable energy mix. Given the extent to which the GST has embedded into its structure a consideration of the exceptional role of various energy sources in India’s energy policy, it is important, therefore, for the tax system to offer exemptions for new and emerging technologies similar to those extended to utility-scale solar and wind in their early days, or equivalent forms of support. It is also important to recognize the heterogeneity of contract types for solar PV projects—deeming 30 per cent of the project cost as supply of services unfairly imposes a higher GST rate on projects where services may in fact have a smaller share (Mercom, 2019). Since solar PV project development cannot be carried out without associated services such as installation and commissioning, supply of services should be ideally treated as being part of a “composite supply” and attract 5 per cent GST. Additionally, the loss of the National Clean Energy and Environment Fund (NCEEF) for renewable energy technologies is a significant reduction in the available resources for new and emerging technologies in India. The government should find a way of at least maintaining funding for clean energy through the NCEEF or an equivalent body, either by using the GST Compensation Cess or through some other mechanism. Finally, increasing the share of renewables in the energy mix is accompanied by grid infrastructure costs, balancing costs and the reduced utilization of thermal power plants. Absorbing these integration costs through government support can accelerate the penetration of solar energy in the near and long terms (Chaturvedi, Koti, & Chordia, 2018). Energy storage is a crucial component of grid balancing and is another key technology development area where targeted subsidies could be used to pursue India’s energy policy targets. IISD.org/gsi 11', '1.0 Introduction In India’s Energy Transition 2018 Update, the Global Subsidies Initiative (GSI) of the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) and the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) published updated estimates of the scale of energy subsidies in India for FY2017, including partial data on the scale of subsidies for FY2018. One of the biggest causes of changes in India’s energy subsidy policy between FY2017 and FY2018 was the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST)—which overhauled a large share of India’s taxes, and, in doing so, its tax-related subsidies. Subsidies and taxation are important because they are the main two tools that governments use to influence prices for different types of energy—and through them, the investment decisions and consumer behaviour that are required to meet their policy objectives. So how did the GST perform from an energy pricing perspective? Were taxes adjusted in ways that were more or less consistent with India’s desired energy future? And how have the final costs of energy been affected? To answer these questions, this brief takes a detailed look at the GST, and in particular, how it has affected the subsidies and pricing of two very different energy sources: coal-fired thermal power; and large-scale on-grid solar power. KEY FINDINGS • By removing exemptions and altering tax rates, the extent of preferential treatment for various energy sources has changed under the GST. Total tax subsidies to both solar PV and coal thermal power have been reduced —but the absolute size of the subsidy to coal-based power remains much higher than for solar PV. • By altering the net tax burden, the GST has also affected the cost of energy production. Our calculations show that, assuming all other factors are held constant, the GST is likely to lead to a significant increase in the cost of generation for new solar PV plants. In contrast, existing coal-fired thermal power plants are likely to experience reduced variable costs under the GST. A lack of data on the fixed costs of new coal plants makes it impossible to calculate the impact of the GST on the overall cost of new coal plants. • The introduction of the GST therefore appears to provide a relative bias in favour of coal-based power. • Detailed assessments of the implications of GST on other renewable energy types including wind are needed to determine unintended impact on relative cost against coal. IISD.org/gsi 1', 'India’s Energy Transition 22', 'India’s Energy Transition 5.0 Conclusions and Recommendations A year and a half into the implementation of the GST, there is a great deal of uncertainty about its net impact on the energy sector in India. This policy brief explored the impact of GST on the costs of solar PV and coal thermal power generation. The GST tax regime has led to a significant increase in the cost of solar PV power generation. At the same time, the variable cost of existing thermal power generation (using domestic coal) has fallen by almost 2 per cent. Thus, the introduction of the GST tax regime is likely to affect the competitiveness of solar PV with respect to coal, which may send signals that influence investment decisions. The uncertainty about how GST will be applied to the sector has also resulted in delays in the deployment of solar PV. This uncertainty, coupled with other policy shocks for th\n",

The clean energy transition will create challenges: as fossil fuel production and consumption decline, governments will need to rethink how they raise revenue from fossil fuels and diversify their revenue base to replace them. Addressing this challenge is not, however, insurmountable. Governments can implement the following policies to secure their financial position during the clean energy transition. Recommendations: 1. Evaluate and report on the flows of government revenues and subsidies related to fossil fuels. Governments should improve transparency by reporting on the scale and type of revenues received from, and subsidies provided to, fossil fuel production and consumption. Subsidy reporting can involve voluntary peer reviews at the national level, under the G20 and reporting on SDG indicator 12.c.1. This will help offer insights to governments in undergoing a fiscal transition away from fossil fuels. 2. Support economic diversification away from fossil fuel dependency. Diversification can shield governments from the risk of falling fossil fuel revenues. All BRICS governments should support economic diversification and the diversification of their energy sectors to mitigate energy transition impacts. In particular, Russia’s national economy is heavily dependent on fossil fuels and would benefit from diversification, as would the subnational coal-producing regions in China, India and South Africa, and oil-producing Rio de Janeiro State in Brazil. Support for economic diversification and diversification of the energy mix necessitates: a) Phasing out fossil fuel subsidies and public finance for fossil fuels. b) Ensuring polluters pay for negative impacts, such as on health and climate, which will create a clear price signal to promote the transition to clean energy. Fossil fuel and carbon taxes play a key role in this respect. c) Reinvesting revenues from fossil fuel production and consumption and savings from subsidy reform into productive uses, such as sustainable infrastructure, education and health. d) Harnessing SOEs and public finance institutions, such as the New Development Bank, as vehicles of diversification for the clean energy transition. e) Targeting support for low-income households (cash transfers, improved social safety nets, etc.) to counteract negative impacts from subsidy removal. f) Ensuring support for a just transition for workers and communities depending on fossil fuels. 7. Ensure fiscal revenue diversification. In the short-to-medium term, the likely pathway for energy transition is for governments to start removing fossil fuel subsidies and increasing taxes on fossil fuels and carbon, in order to price fossil fuels more rationally. All countries, including BRICS, are recommended to ensure that such revenues are well managed but are not seen as a long-term strategy for broadening the tax base. Rather, revenues from fossil fuels, including from emerging carbon pricing, should be used as a temporary bridge to help fund the costs IISD.org/gsi 19', 'Beyond Fossil Fuels: Fiscal transition in BRICS of transition, including mitigating their negative impacts on vulnerable energy consumers and developing programs for a just transition for communities and workers.

IISD.org/gsi 26', 'Beyond Fossil Fuels: Fiscal transition in BRICS Executive Summary The group of countries known as BRICS—Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa—is both influencing and being influenced by global energy markets and the clean energy transition. For BRICS, like all other countries, the clean energy transition is being driven by both external and domestic factors: international climate commitments, plummeting costs of renewables and domestic needs to improve energy efficiency as well as to reduce local air pollution. Large energy importers such as China and India also benefit from domestic generation from renewable sources as a way of decreasing their dependence on imports and improving energy security and trade balance. China and India already invest more in solar and wind than in fossil fuel-based power (International Energy Agency [IEA], 2019a). This report focuses, for the first time, on a specific aspect of the clean energy transition for BRICS: its consequences for government budgets. Based on the BRICS governments’ own reporting, we estimate that, in 2017, taxes and other revenues from both fossil fuel production and consumption amounted to the following shares of general government revenue:1 23.6 per cent (8 per cent of GDP) in Russia, 17.8 per cent (3.7 per cent of GDP) in India, 6.8 per cent (2 per cent of GDP) in Brazil, 6.8 per cent (1.9 per cent of GDP) in South Africa and 4.2 per cent (1.2 per cent of GDP) in China (see Figures 6 and 7 in Section 3 and individual country briefs for more detail). Some of these revenues fluctuate with fossil fuel prices on the world markets. Therefore, the clean energy transition and the ensuing decrease in demand for fossil fuels over the longer term can affect the revenue base for the BRICS governments in two ways: through a drop in fossil fuel prices and through the shrinkage of absolute amounts of fossil fuel production and consumption. Meanwhile, the revenue base is already being eroded by subsidies to both fossil fuel production and consumption. According to the estimates of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), these subsidies amounted to the following shares of general government revenue: 2.4 per cent (0.7 per cent of GDP) in South Africa, 2 per cent (0.4 per cent of GDP) in India, 1.5 per cent (0.5 per cent of GDP) in Russia, 1.1 per cent (0.3 per cent of GDP) in Brazil, and 0.5 per cent (0.1 per cent of GDP) in China (OECD, 2019). In addition, the IEA identifies even larger subsidies to fossil fuel consumption in BRICS (IEA, 2019c) (see Figures 6 and 7 in Section 3). Coal, oil and gas producers may pressure governments for subsidies even more as they seek to remain competitive in light of the clean energy transition. Economic models suggest that the clean energy transition has an overall neutral or beneficial effect on the global economy, but it also leads to losses for fossil fuel-producing segments of the economy (UN Env\n",

It is difficult to debate however, that the relevance and impact of these ESG concerns is not increasing. The mushrooming global LNG market acts to reduce global emissions and air pollution, while also alleviating the historic geopolitical dependence that gas importing nations suffer from, in the grip of gas exporting neighbours who are connected by pipeline. 58 Within that context of gas growth being beneficent for the world, this paper argues that Canadian LNG offers the most compelling overall ESG story to investors, among all global LNG proponents. This advantage, if properly communicated, should effectively increase Canada’s overall competitiveness in the eyes of an ESG-concerned investor.

Local availability and cost competitiveness of natural gas (domestic, pipeline and/or LNG) 2. Volume of methane released across the gas value-chain (from gas well to burner tip) 3. Emissions incurred from production, transmission, and, if LNG, liquefaction, shipping, regasification and secondary transmission For example, the well documented US shale gas boom has led to more than 500 million tonnes of annual CO2 reduction and accounts for just less than one-fifth of all emissions reductions since 2010 in the US — roughly the same amount as for the addition of all renewables in that time. In this case, gas became locally available often at a lower cost/kWh than coal, and emissions in transporting the gas (by pipeline) were de minimis. (It is important to note however, that current flaring in the Permian is rather substantial: Rystad estimates that 0.75 bcfd is currently being flared there, which negates the coal-to- gas switching benefits of roughly the equivalent 0.75 bcfd of gas used in power generation or 15 million tonnes/year.)59,60 Upstream and midstream: methane and electrification The farrago of fact and myth that dominates the LNG value chain methane release discussion (that usually arises with regard to coal-to-gas switching) is difficult to navigate. In North America and globally, adequate measurements are hard to come by.61 Methane release estimates from the gas value chain in the US vary between 0.4 and 1.7%, with an average estimate of around 1.0–1.2%, below the IEA estimated global average of 1.7%; and well below the roughly 3.2% threshold needed to deliver a net GHG savings versus coal-fired turbines.62,63 In comparison, Canada appears to be in the vanguard in the fight to reduce methane release. Estimates of fugitive methane emissions from BC production for example range between 0.2–0.7% of production. (The BC government estimates 0.2–0.3% and at the higher end of the range, prominent anti-fossil fuel development activist group The Suzuki Foundation estimates 0.7%.) 64 , 65 , 66 For its Northeast BC Groundbirch operations, Shell estimates its methane emissions intensity is only 0.1%. A 2018 life-cycle analysis done by the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency concluded that natural gas from U.S. producers could emit as much as eight times more methane than gas produced in B.C. It cited tighter regulations for drilling and natural gas processing in BC compared to the US. Amid a dearth of consistently performed studies, this paper cannot conclusively state that a Canadian LNG value chain emanating from the WCSB will have lower methane emissions than a USGC one, but the data that is available suggests that Canadian emissions are significantly lower than the US on average, and much lower than the global average (1.7%). How is it that using mostly similar unconventional production technology as in the US, Western Canadian producers have demonstrated reduced methane release? They for most the part use the latest technology and techniques to ensure minimal methane leakage and apply LDAR protocols, including airborne and satellite detection techniques.67 Experts also note that additional reductions are made through a process known as “green completions” — a method of capturing “blowback” and preventing venting when a well is first fracked and produced. 85% of the wells drilled in BC were green 59 Using the rough assumption that coal generates double the GHG emissions as natural gas for the same power production 60 JWN Staff. \"Permian Gas Flaring Reaches Yet Another High: Rystad\".

Suzuki Foundation, 2019. 66 The credibility of the Suzuki Foundation is challenged by this paper in that David Suzuki has claimed that “fracked gas has a carbon footprint at least as bad as coal (because of fugitive methane release)”; this is patently false for most global gas production, and especially Canadian gas production. 67 \"Canada\\'s Methane Regulations for The Upstream Oil and Gas Sector\", 2019. https://www.canada.ca/en/environment- climate-change/services/canadian-environmental-protection-act-registry/proposed-methane-regulations-additional- information.html. 15', 'completions in 2017.64 Furthermore, parts of the Montney have become electrified with hydroelectricity. This both reduces GHG emissions by displacing the combustion of natural gas, and also further reduces methane release: producers install electric actuator valves instead of pneumatic ones that release natural gas each time they are activated. (This is partially how Shell reaches their 0.1%.) Today, BC and Alberta are arguably the most progressive gas producing jurisdictions in the world with regard to fugitive methane reduction, and more proactive than the US. This gap is likely to widen since the Trump administration weakened US methane regulation, while Canada has accelerated its government-sponsored methane reduction initiatives.68 (These target a 40-45% reduction on 2012 release rates by 2025.) Several environmentally concerned Canadian producers have developed their own aggressive and technology-driven methane reduction programs that greatly outperform regulations, using the capability as a marketing tool for Canadian production.61,69 Figure 9: BC LNG GHG for liquefaction versus other LNG supply regions %CO2 per tonne LNG 0.35 Global Canada 0.27 0.24 0.22 0.16 0.15 0.10 0.05 Global LNG Cheniere Industry Best Pacific Kwispaa LNG LNG Canada Kitimat LNG Woodfibre Average Sabine (Norway) Northwest (BC) (BC) Shelved (BC) 2023 (BC) ~2028 LNG (BC) Pass (US) Cancelled 2023 Sources: Project-Specific Canadian Environmental Assessment Act Reports, Kwispaa LNG website, Delphi Group70 Liquefaction & shipping Figure 9 shows Canadian proponents to be trailblazers in reducing liquefaction emissions — LNG Canada is designed to be 32% more efficient than the current lowest emitting plant in the world.

Climate Action Tracker (2019) has rated Canada’s current climate change policies as “insufficient” to meet limits for global warming called for in the Paris Agreement, and Canada is currently not on track to meet its 2030 target (UN Environment, 2019). Fossil fuel subsidy reform would strengthen and support wider federal action on climate change and help Canada to meet its climate targets. The purpose of this inventory is not in passing judgment or providing justification on the potential necessity of individual subsidies, as this is the role of government. A transparent inventory of fossil fuel subsidies must include all subsidies, including those with positive (e.g., energy access) and negative (e.g., increased pollution) outcomes. We recommend that, during the peer review process, the government provides a detailed analysis of whether each subsidy is the most cost-effective way to achieve policy objectives, taking into consideration economic, social and environmental costs. If no other option is available, the government should consider how to make the existing subsidy policy more efficient. The government should also ensure policy objectives do not include lowering the cost of fossil fuel production, raising the revenues of fossil fuel producers or lowering the price paid by consumers for fossil fuels, with very limited and well-rationalized exceptions (e.g., energy access for remote communities where no reasonable alternative is available). Canada’s progress on the G20 peer review process with Argentina, while a positive step, has been slow and needs a strong commitment to transparency. The definitions and methodology proposed by Environment and Climate Change Canada in their draft framework require strengthening to ensure action on reforming and phasing out non-tax support to the production and consumption of fossil fuels. As for tax-related measures, while Finance Canada has reformed several tax subsidies since 2011, the department should adopt the transparency of Environment and Climate Change Canada in their approach to identifying and cataloguing remaining tax subsidies that would be subject to reform. Reforming and phasing out fossil fuel subsidies is a critical step to ensure a climate-safe future and transition to a low-carbon economy. Fossil fuel subsidies undermine action on climate change and divert important resources away from areas such as healthcare, education and social services. We recommend that the government: • Commit to not introducing new subsidies for fossil fuels, including measures related to the Trans Mountain pipeline and expansion, with the potential exception of measures explicitly related to energy access where no other viable alternatives exist, as well as measures explicitly designed to support a just transition for fossil fuel workers and their communities. IISD.org/gsi 13\", \"Canada's Federal Fossil Fuel Subsidies in 2020 • Include fossil fuel subsidy reform as a key element of focus in Canada’s next NDC to the Paris Agreement, to support and enhance federal climate ambition. Positive impacts of subsidy reform could be identified through the quantification of associated greenhouse gas emission reductions through the NDC period and beyond. • Transparently release information on quantified amounts of all federal fossil fuel subsidies, including those listed in this report, on an annual basis. • Commit to completing the G20 peer review in 2020, using internationally agreed-upon definitions for subsidies and robust criteria for determining “inefficient” fossil fuel subsidies. • Develop a roadmap to meet or exceed Canada’s commitment to phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies by 2025. • Ensure that transparency on fossil fuel subsidies and related finance is addressed during the legislative review for EDC and that the organization’s policies align with Canada’s climate change and subsidy phase-out commitments. • Work with the provinces and territories to address fossil fuel subsidies at the subnational level. As recent IISD reports on subnational subsidies have shown, total provincial and territorial fossil fuel subsidies are significantly higher than total federal subsidies and represent an important area necessitating increased attention (Corkal & Gass, 2019a, 2019b; Environmental Defence & IISD, 2019; Équiterre & IISD, 2018; Touchette et al., 2017).

The most recent estimate of fossil fuel subsidies in 2019 is nearly CAD 600 million, an increase from our 2018 assessment due to several large investments in oil and gas sector-related infrastructure.1 However, this figure is a conservative estimate, as it does not include subsidies for which publicly available data were lacking, such as tax-related subsidies. Information on subsidies should be more transparent to allow for a more comprehensive inventory. The Canadian government also has committed to phasing out “inefficient fossil fuel subsidies” by 2025 in line with commitments made at the G20 and G7 (G7, 2016; G20, 2009).2 Fossil fuel subsidies at the federal level are largely directed to fossil fuel producers, as opposed to consumers. In particular, the federal government has been supporting the expansion of natural gas production through subsidy measures. Fossil fuel subsidies are just one component of financial, regulatory and policy supports provided to the energy sector. Efforts and subsidies that disproportionately advantage fossil fuels over sustainable energy bear close consideration to determine if they are the most effective means to transition to low-carbon energy. While there are existing subsidies for renewable energy sources, the scope of this inventory focuses on fossil fuel subsidies. Renewable subsidies are generally significantly lower in most countries than fossil fuel subsidies. A detailed comparison between renewable and fossil fuel subsidies has not yet been undertaken in Canada, but at a global level, fossil fuel subsidies outweigh renewable subsidies by a rate of roughly USD 372 billion to USD 100 million (Bridle et al., 2019). This inventory indicates that subsidies have shifted from an emphasis on exploration to one on the development of infrastructure for fossil fuel production and exports. In part, this is because the government has made progress on reforming certain tax provisions, including the rationalization of the eligibility for the Canadian Exploration Expense. Current spending is directed largely at developing infrastructure for proven reserves and providing support for production and export. Two significant examples are the CAD 275 million LNG Canada direct transfer for liquefied natural gas (LNG)\n",

CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE | 77', '1994–2007: Season of Hope—A Better Life for All The first dozen or so years of South Africa’s democracy was a season of hope (as per the title of Alan Hirsch’s book on economic reform under the country’s first two presidents).22 In this hopeful phase of the Hirschman cycle, the country embraced the ANC’s electoral slogan, “a better life for all,” and its vision of realizing mutual gains through cooperation. Realizing this vision was no easy task. As Hirsch (then South Africa’s chief director of economic policy within the office of the presidency) summarized in his book, the crucial challenge was to combine a commitment to growth with a commitment to sharing the benefits of that growth: Was there any point in redistributing a shrinking patrimony, with everyone getting poorer? And, yet, would not fueling economic growth simply put more wealth in the hands of those who already had it? The big economic question faced by the ANC was: What would be the ideal relationship between growth and redistribution in South Africa? Or, more precisely how could it set South Africa on the path of economic growth and at the same time ensure fair, just and politically necessary redistribution outcomes? Put yet another way: was there a way in which growth and redistribution in South Africa could complement each other?23 The effort to combine growth and redistribution required a collective, society-wide commitment— one that cut profoundly against the grain of South Africa’s historical legacy. Centuries of exploitation and oppression had left large residues of suspicion and distrust, along with deeply rooted dysfunc- tional habits of unequal communication across racial lines. Inevitably, the process of effecting change was difficult, with many compromises and not a little conflict. Gradually, gains began to be evident; economic growth accelerated and extreme poverty declined. However, achieving gains in growth and poverty reduction turned out to be the relatively easy parts of the agenda of building a thriving inclusive society. Addressing other dimensions of exclusion and inequality turned out to be more difficult—and the lack of resolution in these other dimensions placed new pressure on institutions. The pressures on institutions were particularly substantial in two aspects of the ANC’s agenda: initiatives to transform the elite through proactive efforts such as the Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) program, and initiatives to use the public sector as part of a broader agenda of transformation. As will become evident, even though some gains were achieved, these initiatives came with internal complications that would set the stage for accelerating difficulties in the 2010s. Before examining the complications, it is worth reviewing South Africa’s achievements in reducing poverty in the post-apartheid era. CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE | 19', 'Poverty-Reducing Growth—Some Achievements Table 6 summarizes South Africa’s real economic growth rates since the dawn of democracy. By the end of the apartheid era, the economy had stopped growing. In the first dozen years of democracy, as confidence in the new system took hold, growth began to accelerate. Indeed, signaling the private sector’s rising confidence, private investment gradually rose as a share of GDP from an average of about 14 percent in the 1990s to 17 percent in 2007. Growth provided the fiscal means for address- ing absolute poverty; the growing economy also offered new opportunities for expanding the middle class and for upward mobility via the private sector. In the absence of growth, however, everything else would become more difficult—as South Africa would discover in time.

Table 7 summarizes the gains in reducing absolute poverty in South Africa. In the early years of democracy, the extension of services was a major focus. Between 1994 and 2003, as a central part of the RDP implementation, more than 1.5 million houses were built for the poor. Access to potable water grew from 60 percent to 80 percent of households between 1998 and 2003, and access to electricity grew from 50 percent to 70 percent of households between 1994 and 2000. Immunization coverage also grew. Beginning in the latter 1990s, as government finances strengthened, South Africa greatly expanded its social grants. Pension payments (which during apartheid years had been generous for white South Africans) were universalized and equalized. A Child Support Grant, the main form of support for 20', 'indigent families, was introduced in 1998 and had reached 3 million children by 2003. By 2010, after the maximum eligibility age was raised several times, more than 10 million of the poorest children in a country with a total population of less than 50 million at that time were receiving child support grants. Social security transfers rose to 3.5 percent of GDP by 2009, representing a concert- ed attempt to ameliorate severe poverty.

            "['6. Appeasement, scams and tension: Affirmative action programs, 1999 to 2006 Affirmative action programs between 1999, after the FLP-led coalition came to power, and the 2006 coup can be understood in terms of three major trends. The first was the failed appeasement strategy by the FLP-led coalition under Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry (1999 to 2000); the second was the use of affirmative action as a conflict resolution mechanism and associated scams (2000-2001); and the third was attempted reconciliation and tension leading to the 2006 coup (2002 to 2006). The dominant feature of the first period was the urgent attempt by the Labour-led coalition to mobilize indigenous Fijian support through the public proclamation of its support for affirmative action: a desperate move to win acceptance in a hostile and volatile political environment. When Chaudhry’s coalition came to power in 1999 it was faced with two seemingly contradictory tasks – first was the urgent need to appease indigenous Fijians by promising to continue with special measures for them while at the same time addressing the interests of Indo-Fijians who voted overwhelmingly for the FLP. This involved a very fine and potentially fragile balancing act to satisfy two communities with different expectations. The appeasement effort did not work because indigenous ethno- nationalists were determined to destabilize Chaudhry’s government, until it was removed in a coup in May 2000. The second phase of affirmative action, carried out by the military-appointed interim government under Laisenia Qarase between the May 2000 coup and August 2001 election, was meant to lessen ethno-political tension in the wake of the 2000 upheaval. However, it was beset by irregularities, corruption and manipulation for electoral gain by the interim ministers. Scams led to the suspension of the affirmative action program as investigations continued into millions of dollars’ worth of fraud. The strategic approach to implement affirmative action initiatives to help take Fiji out of the political doldrums was tainted by abuse of power and lack of proper government purchasing procedures. Paradoxically, the scams did not deter indigenous Fijian voters from voting overwhelmingly for Qarase’s Soqosoqo Duavata Lewenivanua Party (S DL) during the 2001 election. The third phase, between 2001 and 2006, was dominated by the SDL’s use of affirmative action as part of its broader national reconciliation program. Although the victory of the SDL during the 2001 election provided Qarase’s pro-indigenous policies the boost and legitimacy they needed in the wake of the embarrassing scams, the political climate had changed and the military, which supported affirmative action policies immediately after the 2000 coup to help quell tension, was vehemently opposed to some of Qarase’s bold policies, such 141', \"Politics of preferential development as the Qoliqoli Bill and Reconciliation, Tolerance and Unity Bill (RTUB). The tensions which followed culminated in the overthrow of Qarase’s government by the military on 6 December 2006. Appeasement and the 2000 coup In 1999 Mahendra Chaudhry was appointed Fiji’s first Indo-Fijian prime minister after the victory of the Labour-led coalition. This was the first election under the 1997 Constitution which prescribed the alternative voting (AV) system which gave voters the option to either vote “above the line” for the preferred political party (which have already exchanged preferences amongst themselves) or “below the line” for their preferred candidates numbered in order of priority. The AV system was meant to avoid dominance by a single party thus forcing formation of a coalition government as a way of moderating extremist parties and creating middle ground politics. However, the results of the 1999 election did not reflect this expectation. The FLP won all 19 Indo-Fijian communal seats and 18 of the 25 open seats. The NFP, under Jai Ram Reddy, which went into the election by forming a “moderate” alliance with the SVT, under Sitiveni Rabuka, did not win any seat after losing a total of 20. Reddy’s alliance with Rabuka was seen by Indo-Fijians as an act of betrayal and Chaudhry was quick to take advantage of this. The SVT, in power since the 1992 election, won only 8 seats and lost 24. The details of the election results are shown in Table 6.1.

Appeasement, scams and tension: Affirmative action programs, 1999 to 2006 The SVT’s election loss can be attributed directly to a shift in indigenous Fijian support to emerging parties such as the Fijian Association Party (FAP) ,which won 10 seats; the Christian Democratic Alliance (CDA), 3 seats; the Nationalist Vanua Tako Lavo Party (NVTLP), 2 seats; and the Party of National Unity (PANU), 2 seats. Division within the ranks of indigenous Fijians was of significant advantage to the Fiji Labour Party, which formed a coalition government with the FAP, led by Kuini Speed, Bavadra’s former wife, and the CDA, which was set up with the blessing of the President, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara. Of the 18 cabinet posts, 11 were allocated to indigenous Fijians, a move which was generally interpreted as Chaudhry’s tactical manoeuvre to appease indigenous Fijians. In response to threats of violence and destabilization, one of the very first tasks for Chaudhry when he became prime minister was to allay fears that he would revoke existing affirmative action programs. The first assurance was provided by the president, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, who during his speech to open parliament on 15 June 1999 emphasised the Labour-led coalition’s commitment to safeguarding and protecting the rights and interests of the indigenous people of Fiji as enshrined in the constitution (Mara 1999). In his address to the GCC in the same month Chaudhry proclaimed in no uncertain terms that the Labour-led coalition fully recognized the unique and special position of indigenous Fijians and Rotumans and emphasized continued assistance in the areas of education, land, housing and participation in business. He promised the chiefs that $5 million would be set aside for indigenous Fijian education. He also expressed concern about the low success rate of indigenous business and one of the solutions he offered was injection of funds for more training and management support and guidance (Chaudhry 1999). As a way of winning popular support, the coalition devised a pro-poor economic policy, which was contained in the 2000 national budget announced at the end of 1999. The budget emphasised the importance of the social service sector, notably education, social welfare, poverty alleviation, healthcare and micro- enterprise initiatives for those who wanted to start their own business. There was also a proposal for the removal of Value Added Tax (VAT) on some basic food items as well as reduced housing rates, electricity and water rates (Fiji Government 1999). There was an increase in Family Assistance Allowance by $1.5 million to $5.6 million. In addition, the Housing Authority interest rate for those with income below $6,500 was reduced from 11.5% to 6% and over time the interest rate for those with a salary above $6,500 would be decreased progressively. The Coalition also introduced the Student Loan Scheme to enable children from poor families to attend tertiary institutions. The government also put a stop to some privatization initiatives and started a review of the rice quota for import and export. 143', 'Politics of preferential development Buoyed by the popular pro-poor policies, the coalition government started treading on more politically sensitive ground. For instance, they set up a commission of inquiry to carry out an investigation into the government tendering process of the privatisation deals, corrupt practices within the civil service, tax evasion practices of prominent indigenous Fijian and Indo-Fijian businessmen and the tendering process for the mahogany forest harvesting and Y2K computer systems upgrade contracts, of which it was alleged that thousands of dollars changed hands between big companies and prominent indigenous Fijians. Some of these issues were very closely tied up with affirmative action, especially with regards to government tenders in favour of indigenous Fijian contractors. Opponents interpreted these moves as Chaudhry’s attempt to deepen his hegemonic control of the state system, weaken the power of the business community and above all indirectly undermine affirmative action despite his public rhetoric about support for indigenous interests. This sentiment, often coloured by nationalist overtones, was echoed by George Speight, the self-styled leader of the 2000 coup, when he wrote to the GCC after his illegal instalment as prime minister in May 2000 that “before the People’s Coalition Party came to power, Mr Chaudhry was a leading opposition spokesperson, who was always critical of affirmative action in favour of the indigenous community” and he “made sure when he came to power that this affirmative action, in favour of the indigenous co\n",

            "['CHAPTER 12 Policy, pursuit of the ‘turn to the left’ and the paradox of continuity The system is changing and the challenges are changing. One can never respond to new challenges by trying to reproduce the responses which had their efficacy in a previous period. Samir Amin, 19971 Democratic South Africa at its worst was preferable to apartheid South Africa at its best, yet its deficits and fault lines were frightening. This was not for a lack of policy proposals and adoption. More than 17 years of policy action had brought extensive change, yet fell far short of both the ideals of the Freedom Charter and the 1994 humanitarian benchmarks. Change was differential, as evident in race-class-gender permutations. Policy debates shifted over time. They veered between statements of ‘change pending’, ‘good policies, but failures on implementation’, ‘Mbeki-ites failing the people’, ‘improve representation and accountability by repre- sentatives’, and ‘root out corruption’, to the muted ‘new initiatives in the Zuma admin- istration’, ‘implement the Polokwane resolutions’ and ‘we did not know’ (about severe conditions on the ground circa local election 2011). The ANC was conflicted between when to claim policy successes and when to acknowledge failures. The ‘challenge’ was to get replacement and supplementary policies adopted, while building state capacity and public sector integrity and dedication to unambiguously serve the people. It was a tall but unavoidable order. Without realising it, the ANC in the longer term would be increasingly dependent on propaganda and manipulation of popular consciousness to secure continued belief in it and to renew its power. Concerted policy implementation would have been much more achievable in South Africa, had policy not also been at the heart of political contestation – frequently being the code or proxy speak for contests and lines of division. Simultaneously, significant players clamoured for positioning to direct and control policy. The substantial intra- ANC and intra-Alliance contests clouded policy pursuits. Policy was a form of political combat in party and in state, central to the ANC succession battles in the 2009-onwards Zuma administration, and it became a proxy strategy in campaigning for Mangaung', '445 2012. In the Polokwane round it was situated amidst intense turmoil and potential instability, mostly to do with leadership replacement. For some, Polokwane was the moment to get policy change; others used accusations of policy failure and advocacy as a vaguely defined instrument to get leadership turnover. ANC and ANC-in-government policy action since 1994 rendered a cumulative product that combined social-welfarist social concern with the poor and oppressed, with liberal-democratic and conservative-neoliberal components ... and the collective policy amalgam fell short of expectations of bringing in jobs, reducing poverty and inequality, and making communities feel the 1994 dream was within their grasp.2 The ANC fostered a balance between neo-liberal economic fundamentals that had been associated with the Growth, Employment and Redistribution (Gear) strategy,3 replaced- supplemented with the New Growth Path (NGP) in 2010, commitment to a develop- ment-state-cum-welfare-state, the interracial movement of capital, and policy determination through global policy networks. The ANC’s ideological policy amalgam by 2011 only hinted at the deep ideals of preceding contestation. The blend of left-social democracy, state responsibility (for social-grant socialism), combined with nationalist and liberal thrusts, revealed paradoxes which were explained through the ‘current stage of the national democratic revolution’ while awaiting full and substantive democracy.4 This would have been a steadfast track, had the 1994 socio-economic ideals not been so far removed from the 2011 reality. The chapter tracks an extraordinary period of policy contestation in 2005-11, which accompanied the ANC’s succession wars, the years of the Zuma administration, and two ANC succession races (in which the ANCYL variably positioned itself). It was through twinning with the succession battles that the ANC alliance partners, Cosatu and the SACP, tried to broaden prevailing policy parameters. Direct policy influence and immediately-amended policies was their first prize. The second prize was positioning for policy influence within the heart of government. Zuma succession struggle debt was their bargaining chip, along with reminders of the policy planning and implementation deficit that was passed on from the Mbeki era. The ANC’s insistence that it was bound by its Polokwane policy resolutions and its reminders – in similar vein from Mbeki and Zuma – that the ANC was not a socialist organisation affected their capture of these prizes. Mbeki,5 Midrand 2007, famously stated that the SACP ‘has always understood that it could not delegate its socialist tasks to the ANC, consistent with the fact that the tasks of the socialist revolution could not be delegated to the national democratic revolution...’ Zuma reiterated this at a later stage.6 That time around, given friendlier alliance dynamics, the partners did not object. The ANCYL’s calls for ‘economic lib- eration’ circa 2009-11 supplemented the policy debates – whilst dramatically meshing policy, succession and individual beneficiation. The chapter highlights the setting and discourses of policy change, and then dissects the policy debates of 2005-11. The focus is on the interfaces between ANC policy, suc- cession and the longer-term generation of popular power through successful policy. The constructs of ‘interface of policy and succession’ and ‘concentric contests for succession, party-state predominance, and alliance centres of power’ structure the chapter. Policy, pursuit of the ‘turn to the left’ and the paradox of continuity', '446 MAPPING THE SUCCESSION POLICY CONTESTATION INTERFACES The ANC presidential succession of December 2007, the national-South African pres- idential succession of April 2009, and subsequent positioning for Mangaung 2012 exposed the interfaces between policy and succession politics. At times the battles for supremacy of the ANC over the state, and of alliance partners and sympathetic segments of the ANC for dominance over the Tripartite Alliance, stood at the centre of this cross- ing point. The succession events came to symbolise policy contests, struggles for optimal policy content, the need to subvert deficits, and positioning of the state and its func- tionaries in relation to private capital. Due to concentrated attention to policy and stock-taking – and even if policy came to be used as a weapon in succession battles – the succession periods delivered windows for change. Much would remain unaltered once the dust had settled, but the push to reassess and justify retentions heightened accountability and delivered reminders of the responsibility to get ‘best policy practice’ activated. The primary challenge come 2011 was to show that implementation would be pursued with as much political will as policy and policy-institutional design. Direct actions of policy contestation are important. They include positions put for- ward in policy debates and proposed policy alternatives. In conditions of intra-party succession (where derived consensus and internal discipline are valued and enforced) policy contestation in indirect guises rivals the ‘direct’. Such policy challenges came in guises of attacks on personality, leadership style, custodianship of liberation movement character, representation of the working class, and organisation of the state policy processes. The literature on policy-making is rich in insights into policy making processes and models to assess change and continuity. Yet, it offers little analytical guid- ance for policy contestation in instances of intra-party succession.7 To this end, the chapter identifies two intersecting constructs to analyse the South African case: • The first is simply the policy-succession interface. The analysis explores details of how policy affected successions, and the manner in which successions impacted policy (Figure 1). • The second comprises three concentric battles that continuously characterise policy contestation – succession battles, the battle for primacy amongst Tripartite Alliance partners, and the battle of state-versus-party (Figure 2). The policy contests – sometimes mock contests – played out in politics and ideology in a domain demarcated by institutions and populated by intra-ANC factions, provinces and leagues, and the two alliance partners. For the Alliance the 2007-09 succession was about capturing the heart of the ANC-in-government, to assert themselves as dom- inant policy forces, in a movement in which they had become alienated. Alliance mem- bers were the main protagonists in first challenging Mbeki’s relative insulation from the ANC in the west wing of the Union Buildings, then the Zuma administration’s insistence on the ANC being the centre of power, and then to battle in the complex Mangaung alliances. The 2010-11 alliance positioning was even more complex. The ANC POWER AND STATE POWER', '447 ANCYL was trying to claim a status superior to the alliance partners, the SACP was effectively integrated in the Zuma government (with sub-optimal policy influence), the ANC repeatedly asserted itself as the Alliance’s centre of power, and Cosatu was hovering as watchdog over the ANC predators in government.

Th e ARP has now been operational for over a decade and has att racted both accolades and criticism. On World Habitat Day, 2009, the ARP was awarded a United Nations’ Scroll of Honour with the following citation: For helping thousands of poor people move into bett er homes and boosting health, water and electricity services. Th is renewal project has seen some 7,000 families relocated from the banks of a polluted local river to bett er sett lements. Urban greening was incorporated in the project which led to development of parks and recreation areas. Th e project also saw the development of new housing, new schools and the refurbishment of many facilities. New clinics improved access to healthcare; while 46,000 hygienic refuse bins have been distributed, drastically improving garbage collection. More than 70 percent of the residents now have access to water and sanitation and 88 percent have safe electricity, a major milestone in a place once referred to as ‘Dark City’.1 Th e ARP submission to UN Habitat claimed that ‘the development of ARP over time has fundamentally transformed the physical, economic and social environment of Alexandra’.2 Within the township, the Alexandra Development Forum has wide-ranging representation from community groupings across the township and provides broad support for the ARP. 342 CSCC.indb 342 2014/10/07 5:19 PM', 'Towns Gautrain stations Gautrain route National roads BRT route Alexandra Settlements mentioned in chapter Gauteng municipalities City of Johannesburg Figure 17.1: Alexandra within Greater Johannesburg, 2009 Data sources: GDED (2009); MDB (2010). Cartography by Jennifer Paul 343 CSCC.indb 343 2014/10/07 5:19 PM', 'There are, however, bitter critics who claim that the ARP has failed. For example, the Marlboro South Industrial Organisation, which represents mainly white-owned industry on the northern edge of Alexandra, has set up a web page on the ‘ARP failure’.3 Within the township, the youth wing of the Alexandra Land and Property Owners Association (ALPOA) has demanded the disbanding of the ARP, a call endorsed by the chairman of ALPOA who described the ARP as having done ‘a shoddy job with the renewal of the township’.4 The Alexandra Vukuzenzele Crisis Committee, affiliated to the Anti-Privatisation Forum, has refused to join the Alexandra Development Forum and is deeply critical of the ARP, engaging in periodic protest action, including the unauthorised occupation of houses.5 Faced with these opposing views, the compelling question is whether the ARP has failed or succeeded in its objective to transform Alexandra. This is not merely an academic question as it speaks directly and profoundly to a critical concern with the impacts of state- initiated development in South Africa. The government of post-apartheid South Africa has focused much of its energy and resources on the delivery of housing and basic services to previously marginalised communities and individuals, yet it is now confronted with endemic service-delivery protests and deep scepticism about its capacity to deliver. As the largest area-based development urban project in the country, the ARP is arguably the government’s most important intervention. The state has spent more than R2 billion on the ARP, and both the provincial and city governments have invested enormous energy in the project. If the ARP has failed, what does this say about prospects for state-led development in South Africa into the future? If the ARP has succeeded, a valuable set of lessons will have been learned that could have implications for development elsewhere. Determining success or failure is a hugely complex task. Do we, for example, evaluate the ARP in terms of its original stated objectives or in terms of its ability to adapt and reconfigure in relation to an evolving context? We can count the number of houses provided and calculate the expenditure on infrastructure but how do we determine the impact of the project on the lived experiences of people in the township, especially when the community is so segmented and interests are so divergent? How do we disentangle the effects of the ARP from the effects of other state policies and interventions, or the effects of macro processes such as the changing state of the economy? With its official life coming to an end, there is arguably a need for a critical and independent assessment of the outcomes of the ARP. This would be a large undertaking and we do not attempt it here. What we offer is a limited assessment, focused specifically on the spatial outcomes of the project on the development of the township (while taking into account the relationship between the physical and its broader socio-political and economic milieus). In considering spatial impacts and outcomes, it is impossible to separate the effects of the ARP from the long history of planning and development interventions in Alexandra. In fact, the spatial objectives of the ARP only make sense in relation to the spatial objectives 344 Changing SpaCe, Changing City CSCC.indb 344 2014/10/07 5:19 PM', 'of earlier initiatives. While the ARP does represent an important and progressive shift in developing thinking and practice, it also has elements of continuity with the past. This is most starkly represented in terms of its spatial objective of de-densification. The de-densification objective crossed over from apartheid to post-apartheid planning and from the designs of state planners into the internal politics of the township. Much of this complex politics of the current day has to do with who the various interest groups consider to be bona fide residents of the township and therefore who has the right to benefits such as housing. A critical question for an evaluation of any development initiative in Alexandra is whether interventions have been geared towards addressing the specificities of the township. Particularly important is whether these interventions have recognised the spatial role of Alexandra as a place that is extremely well located in Greater Johannesburg and that provides established residents and new migrants with good access to job and livelihood opportunities. In making our arguments around the history of planning interventions in Alexandra we draw liberally on the wonderfully detailed account of the township’s social and political history in Philip Bonner and Noor Nieftagodien’s ALEXandra: A History (2008), and also on a number of other contributions including Pauline Morris’s critique of pre-2000 spatial planning (Morris 2000). Our assessment of the success or otherwise of the ARP comes from two angles. First, we use the official reports provided by the ARP and supplement this with analysis based on Statistics South Africa’s national population Census, and on aerial photography and spatial data provided by GeoTerraImage (GTI). Second, we undertook a select number of interviews with residents of Alexandra to get a sense of local perceptions of the ARP, and with existing and previous officials of the ARP, as well as with consultants to the ARP. ‘Insiders’ and ‘outsiders’: a socio-spatial history of Alexandra From the very beginning of Alexandra’s history a distinction was made between insiders and outsiders – between those who could claim a right to be in there and those who, at best, were temporary sojourners. The divide between insiders and outsiders evolved over time and was often contested but it has remained a key element in the politics and spatial planning of the township. Even today a complex layering of perceived rights of residence and occupation persists, and is intelligible only in relation to the township’s convoluted history. Former stand holders and their descendants claim greater rights than residents living in irregular dwellings in the backyards of the large stands. Backyard dwellers in turn place themselves ahead of those living in free-standing informal settlements, such as those on the banks of the Jukskei River, and especially ahead of those who have a foreign nationality. The history of Alexandra is well recorded by Bonner and Nieftagodien (2008) and need not be repeated here.

It narrowly escaped the strictures of the 1913 Native Land Act and became one of few places where urban land could be owned by black South Africans. The township filled up gradually at first, reaching a population of only 7 200 by 1929. From the 1930s, however, the population increased rapidly, with an estimated 50 000 by the mid 1940s and 100 000 by the mid 1950s. This growth was fuelled by rapid rural–urban migration and by displacement of Africans from inner-city slums following the enactment of the Slums Act of 1934. A sharp distinction emerged between the relatively affluent propertied class in the township who had been in Alexandra from the beginning and the tenants who came later and who rented rooms in the yards.6 With its continued growth and densification, Alexandra required urban services but neither the Johannesburg City Council nor the Transvaal Provincial Administration was prepared to take responsibility for this. The Alexandra Health Committee, formed in 1921, included individuals who represented the stand holders but the Committee had few resources and was plagued by internal rivalries. It was eventually dissolved in 1958 when Alexandra fell under the direct control of national government through the administration of the Peri\n",

Understanding resource governance in such areas is crucial, as it not only strengthens awareness of conservation but also sheds light on the complexities involved due to the different perceptions and interests of parties involved. The paper explores the opportunities and challenges associated with managing resources in sustainable ways. The case study reveals that, although there is an increase of local awareness on conservation, community dependence on forestlands remains much the same. It also shows that decentralisation processes can have detrimental effects on the resources being used.

Border regions are usually rich in unexploited natural resources that are accessible from both sides of the frontier. This consequently increases the mobility of people, and goods and services across the border. However, intensified cross-border exchanges have unavoidably escalated burdens on natural resources1 due to a consequent exploitation. These challenges and pressures have led to various responses and initiatives for transboundary cooperation on natural resource management. The boundary between Betung Kerihun National Park (BKNP) in the Kapuas Hulu district, West Kalimantan, Indonesia, and the Lanjak Entimau Wild Sanctuary (LEWS) of Sarawak, Malaysia, is an example of the dynamic trends of managing natural resources in a border region. LEWS covers 187,000 hectares (ha) of protected areas while BKNP is spread over nearly 800,000 ha.2 Although there have been economic and political tensions at the borders between the two countries, the relations between Indonesia and Malaysia remain good. Both countries’ governments are actively engaged in cross-border initiatives and have indicated continued support. The cooperation includes joint ecotourism activities and community-related projects development. BKNP is the largest conservation area in Kapuas Hulu. It occupies around 25 per cent of the district area and includes highly diverse flora. Its forest ecosystem also provides significant natural habitats for the rich fauna, many of which are rare species, such as the Bornean orang-utan (Pongo pygmaeus). Due to these conditions, Kapuas Hulu declared itself a conservation district in 2003. There were already established collaborations on transboundary management between Malaysia and Indonesia prior to BKNP and LEWS. One of these collaborations was the transboundary biodiversity conservation areas (TBCAs), which were inaugurated in 1993. The TBCA shares many common features in landscapes, water reserves, ethnographic history, culture, and flora and fauna resources.3 The initiative has been a model for other collaborative actions on both sides of the border. In 1997, the International Tropical Timber Organization’s (ITTO) Borneo Biodiversity Expedition to the TBCA marked the development of scientific cooperation between the two countries. In 2001, the Sarawak government approved the addition of Batang Ai National Park (BANP) located in south LEWS to the TBCA.4 The BKNP area is also a focus of transnational cooperation under the Heart of Borneo (HoB) initiative involving Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei Darussalam. Although some progress has been made through the TBCA project and other initiatives, the management of conservation areas around this border region still faces several challenges, such as: (i) lack of local capacity in building on the partnership; (ii) joint activities, such as joint patrols, cross-border visits and information exchange, are not developed; (iii) limited local ability to understand protected areas management; (iv) limited awareness of conservation issues among 1 The initial concept of conservation district for Kapuas Hulu is like two sides of the same coin where the 2 Paul P. K. Chai and Penguang Manggil, ‘Thinking outside the box’, ITTO Tropical Forest Update 13, no. 2 (2003): 15. 3 Ibid. 4 James K. Gasana, P. P. K. Chai and Y. Trisurat, ‘The management of protected areas in borderlands: Understanding the processes of transboundary biodiversity conservation’ (Bern: Swiss Organization for Development and Cooperation, 2004). 1', 'local people in border areas; (v) lack of resources for forest patrols; and, (vi) a multi- stakeholder process to formulate a work plan is not in place.5 Cooperation between Indonesia and Malaysia in forest conservation entails some prospects for both countries. Many of the communities on the frontier share commonalities with respect to ethnic, linguistic and cultural identities. These common identities have benefited both communities through improving employment, trade and social conditions, even though the direction of movement is more toward Malaysia.6 Shared benefits are also derived from joint ecotourism activities to promote the culture, adventure and natural history of the national parks. Some issues, however, hinder efforts to maintain resource governance in the border areas of Kapuas Hulu. Growing mobility across borders raises problems of sovereignty and security when it includes illegal activities or trade. This can create a mutual distrust between stakeholders from both countries and hamper efforts on conservation. Political decentralisation in Indonesia, which has been imposed since 1999, is another challenge for resource governance. There have been competing interests between central and local governments due to differences in their interpretation of decentralisation regulation. When the central government revoked the authority of local governments to issue logging permits, local governments often delayed it. Instead, local governments collect local taxes from timber activities.7 Development of oil palm corridors is perhaps the most challenging issue for the sustainability of resource governance. Implementing oil palm development involves many trade-offs. While it is profitable for economic development, it also threatens local livelihoods. It threatens rich biological diversity, but also offers financial support for forest conservation efforts. Oil palm is a renewable source of fuel, but it also has potential to increase global carbon emissions.8 Thus, oil palm development has always been a dilemmatic choice. The central government cannot effectively monitor and manage resources in border areas, thus it is necessary to involve stakeholders from all levels: national, regional and district government; private sector; non-governmental organisations (NGOs); and, local communities. Understanding resource governance in border areas is important, as it not only strengthens awareness of conservation itself but also gives a better picture of the complexities at play when it takes into account competing interests among the parties involved. To better understand the dynamics of natural resource governance in the border region, I seek to identify the challenges and opportunities of natural resource governance in the border region of Kapuas Hulu.

            "['6 Eco-Industrial Clusters: Implications for Policy Making 6.0 Making Sense of Eco-Industrial Clusters This study began with the question: Can eco-industrial clusters located in urban- rural fringe areas unleash the synergy between the environment and economic development. Analysis of internal working and external environment of clusters in Asia suggest that the answer must be yes, but that is not the end. Eco- industrial clusters in urban fringe areas are at different levels of development, and their ability to contribute to sustainable development varies accordingly. Eco-industrial clusters can and do contribute for preserving the environment and local development, but in different ways. Those in the first group make their contribution mainly by building a productive environment that in some aspects at least prepares the ground for the emergence of collective eco-efficiency. Clustering clearly facilitates market access and allows some firms to produce their eco-products in quantity. The fact that the firms are clustered also encourages associational environmental activity to begin. It is no coincidence that associations in such clusters focus on improving or gaining policy support or access to needed services. In Asia, infrastructure is the most basic needs of cluster formation. Without them, they are unlikely to move ahead. The second group of clusters has much clear signs of emerging collective efficiency. These clusters have already started enjoying economic benefits, but remain constrained by the weak technology for further inter-firm network to evolve and the frequent sidetracking of associational activity. Greater specialization and differentiation of firms leads to bilateral production technologies and ultimately higher eco-efficiency. Higher-level technologies in at least some of the firms set the stage for positive technological spillovers. In cases, where basic infrastructural and input needs have been met, associations can begin to deal with issues of market and technology. Table 6.1 presents a comparative overview of the features of the clusters studied.', '198 Eco-Industrial Clusters in Urban-Rural Fringe Areas Table 6.1 Comparative Evaluation of Research Clusters Countries and Industrial Clusters Key Factors India Japan Thailand Vietnam Sericulture Wood Rice & Livestock Fishery Nature of Supply–led, Demand–led, Demand–led, Demand–led, Market mainly secondary domestic regional, passive mainly export, towns exports limited domestic Producers & Lead firms & Large Firms & Foreign Buyers Key Players Development Environmental Social & Assistance Policy Policy Development Industrial Policy Policy Extensive Evidence of multilateral Effective Inter-firm Weak bilateral cooperation horizontal Extensive Networks linkages subcontracting focussed on linkages supply chain Product/market Zero-emission, Waste Improved water Key diversification, Eco-product management, quality, Benefits Employment development Income Employment generation generation Role of Significant.

They aim for wider markets, both national and international and are generally able to produce competitively. However, the resemblance between them ends. The Maniwa cluster is situated squarely within eco-industrialization process. Market access, labor market pooling, intermediate effects and technological spillovers are all present and positive. The Vietnam cluster is not characterized by extensive and varied', 'Eco-Industrial Clusters in Rural-Urban Fringe Areas 199 linkages – bilateral and multilateral, vertical and horizontal – that result in joint action in production and on key issues affecting the cluster. The greatest need in this and other alike is for continuing market analysis, focused particularly on the export market and for upgrading the small firm segment of the cluster to encourage equal sharing of benefits. The existing associations can probably handle the first task, but the small firms need assistance of government or NGOs in their efforts to strengthen their position. The Maniwa cluster, on the other hand is fragile from the eco-products developed. It has to weather frequent shocks, if the weak mechanism for joint action by the METI, MAFE, MOE raise questions about its ability to step-up output and quality. The unequal power relationship between the forest associations and furniture makers on the one hand, and the large wood traders and log processors on the other hand, mean that even when the clusters flourishes, the benefits are not well shared. Furthermore, the challenge of dwindling domestic wood supplies has not been adequately dealt with. All of these problems suggest that those concerned need to work together. This will require new forms of public-private partnership. The analysis raises other issues that cut across the three grouping of clusters. The first of these has to with the interplay of market access and firm growth. Across the clusters analyzed, there is evidence that clustering reduces growth constraints frequently identified on literatures on small enterprises. The most notable example is access to market. All clusters have been able to attract customers, from traders to final consumers, a result of the concentration of producers. The problems are that the size of the eco-markets they are connected to in most cases remain small. This may partly explain why specialization and skill development have failed to develop very far in most of the small enterprise clusters as well as why the middle sized firms, generally found in clusters everywhere, are missing. 6.2 Institutional Issues Another issue that cuts across the clusters grouping concerns the relationship of institutions to cluster development. Institutional issues take place in at least two different forms. The first is the failure in many instances of institutionalized cooperation, especially associational activity, to improve cluster operations. One would expect that associations and cooperatives, as vehicles for bringing', '200 Eco-Industrial Clusters in Urban-Rural Fringe Areas together persons with similar interests would be string forces for positive strong joint action. Figure 6.1 presents the results of aspirations of stakeholders expressed during the consultation meetings held in India, Thailand and Vietnam. The role of various agencies as viewed by the stakeholders of eco-industrial cluster formation indicates that frequently policy environment drives the cluster initiative. Some like the Maniwa community initiatives in Japan are adjudged as social capital creation. Other seems to get sidetracked or bogged down in a single difficult problem. The reasons advanced to explain particular cases often do not apply more generally. For example, both the Sericulture Institute and Thailand Environmental Institute were creations of government rather than of the community membership. Yet one appears to be at least attempting to address the clusters strategic needs, while the other is languishing as a government ‘errand boy’. Research focused on these institutions and their multiple linkages is probably needed to assess their potential role as engines of cluster development.

In several clusters, for example, it was observed that producer’s lack of ability to enforce commercial contracts narrows the market and (or) limits operations to cash transaction. Such a situation constraints business activity and makes a firm', 'Eco-Industrial Clusters in Rural-Urban Fringe Areas 201 vulnerable to shocks, sometimes on large scale. Much more research, especially comparative research, on the development of economic institutions within the cluster has to be undertaken. Such research should consider social and political as well as economic factors affecting the genesis and growth of institutions. Micro-finance programs and activities figure prominently in clusters of India; some companies engage in both financial services and manufacturing. The relationship is an important one, not only because it offers some firms the opportunity to realize economies of scope, but also because industrial history in many countries and sectors shows manufacturing growing out of financing. This is beginning to happen in some of the clusters studied. Whether significant small-scale manufacturing can develop from these activities will depend, among other things, on the size of the markets these companies can access and their ability to compete in terms of quality and price with newly available imports from outside. Many of the small enterprise clusters derive in one way or another from the implementation of government spatial policies barring certain activities fr\n",

IN20-07, October 2020 This insight is part of the centre’s COVID-19 series, looking at current developments in the global pandemic and its future implications for the social, political and economic spheres in the region. Green Recovery in Post-COVID-19 Southeast Asia? By Margareth Sembiring The COVID-19 pandemic has inflicted unprecedented economic damages across the globe. Amidst rigorous efforts to manage immediate issues like job losses and business displacements, low-carbon proponents have begun to make calls for a green recovery. In Southeast Asia, an intentional shift towards a green recovery seems unlikely. This is because governments fall back on existing development plans as the basis for economic recovery strategy. As green agenda has been weakly integrated in existing development plans, the progress of climate mitigation in Southeast Asia is likely to remain slow and mixed at best, with a possibility of it getting weakened because of a strong focus on the economy after the pandemic. This development thus highlights the continuing challenges in implementing green growth ideals as the main strategy in addressing climate change.

Despite the criticality of green growth in the climate race, observations made on these countries suggest that a green recovery is unlikely to be the case in Southeast Asia. This is because governments’ recovery responses are heavily focused on economic growth, which has been weakly linked to the green ideals needed to achieve the 1.50C limit. As such, the progress of green agenda in the region is likely to remain slow and mixed at best and may even get weakened because of a strong focus on the economy after the pandemic. The study serves as an important review of the practicability of green growth as the dominant strategy in addressing climate change. With a closing time window to reach the 1.50C target, it thus provides a point for reflection of the possibility of pursuing alternative means to keep the rise of world’s temperature within the stipulated limit. In the case of developing countries in Southeast Asia, this may mean eschewing the current linear production-consumption model and urgently implementing circular economy, strengthening the waste management sector, and enforcing environmental laws consistently. 1“Cut Global Emissions by 7.6 Percent Every Year for Next Decade to Meet Paris Target – UN Report,” United Nations Climate Change, last modified November 26, 2019, https://unfccc.int/news/cut-global-emissions-by-76-percent-every-year-for-next-decade-to-meet-15degc-paris-target-un-report. 2', 'The Unlikely Green Recovery Pathway in Southeast Asia There is no single definition of green growth,2 but there is one common principle behind it. In essence, green growth envisions continuing economic growth while being friendly to the environment. Although green growth can be pursued through a wide range of measures such as the use of biofuels and cleaner coal, carbon tax, improved agriculture practices, reforestation, among others, the dominant strategy in green growth is the decoupling of economic growth from carbon emissions and material use through the application of technology. A special emphasis is given to interventions in the energy sector, which is the single largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and consequently, to climate change. This is evidenced in low-carbon technologies such as electric vehicles and wind and solar power that are developed to replace conventional high-carbon counterparts, and in other technological advancements aimed at increasing efficiency and recyclability. Making economic growth environmentally friendly, however, is not the main reason behind the push for green growth. More importantly, green growth serves as a principal solution to address climate change. Positioning green growth within climate change context sets it on a timescale. This is because the world only has ten years until 2030 to reduce emissions by 7.6 percent every year to achieve 1.50C Paris target.3 The shortening time window leads to a narrowing range of options deemed favourable for green growth. This is manifested in a heightened pressure to go 100 percent renewables,4 which may be very challenging if not impossible to attain, and an increasingly hostile attitude towards anything carbon. Demands to completely phase out coal plants and rapidly switch them to wind and solar plants are among the most common examples. Others include calls to end fuel subsidies, increase carbon taxes, introduce electric vehicles, impose conditions for the aviation sector, and build low and zero-energy buildings. To put it simply, green growth in its present form is tantamount to a commitment to electrify the economy and decarbonise the energy sector, in support of economic growth. Southeast Asia Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, countries in Southeast Asia had embarked on various climate mitigation measures. These included renewable energy development. When the pandemic hit the region, solar and wind energy businesses were affected by the restrictions on movements of goods and people that governments imposed as a response to the health crisis. This has resulted in ongoing projects getting halted, call for tender and commencement of new projects getting delayed, and costs soaring up due to fluctuating foreign exchange rates, among others. The economic downturn has also 2 A non-exhaustive list of definitions is as follow: a) The OECD defines green growth as “fostering economic growth and development while ensuring that natural assets continue to provide the resources and environmental services on which our well-being relies” (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Towards Green Growth (Paris: OECD, 2011), 4); b) The World Bank defines green growth as “growth that is efficient in its use of natural resources, clean in that it minimizes pollution and environmental impacts, and resilient in that it accounts for natural hazards and the role of environmental management and natural capital in preventing physical disasters” (World Bank, Inclusive Green Growth: The Pathway to Sustainable Development (Washington, DC: World Bank, 2012), 2); c) UNEP uses the term green economy and defines it as “one that results in improved human well-being and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities.”(United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Towards a Green Economy: Pathways to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication – A Synthesis for Policy Makers (Nairobi: UNEP, 2011), 1). 3“Cut Global Emissions by 7.6 Percent Every Year for Next Decade to Meet Paris Target – UN Report,” United Nations Climate Change, last modified November 26, 2019, https://unfccc.int/news/cut-global-emissions-by-76-percent-every-year-for-next-decade-to-meet-15degc-paris-target-un-report. 4 See for example: “The Global Price Tag for 100 Percent Renewable Energy: $73 Trillion,” Yale Environment 360, last modified December 20, 2019, https://e360.yale.edu/digest/the-global-price-tag-for-100-percent-renewable-energy-73-trillion. 3', 'global oil price that has plummeted due to low demand and oversupply is likely to pose a stiff competition against renewables. During such time, governments responded with stimulus measures that primarily aimed at stabilising the economy and assisting affected population and businesses. Since the economic hardship upset almost all sectors, government incentives did not necessarily give renewable energy sector a preferential treatment. The present climate race, however, does not halt with the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic. Climate change potentially increases the frequency and intensity of flooding, typhoons, landslides, among others, and their implications on food security, livelihoods, and social stability, continue to pose a major risk in the region. Although pandemic lockdowns have slowed down economy activities and are consequently projected to result in up to 7 percent drop in carbon emissions this year,5 such a drop is unlikely to sustain when economies get back on their feet again. Choosing a green recovery pathway, which essentially entails sweeping investment shifts to low- or zero-emission technologies and infrastructure across multiple sectors,6 is therefore seen as a plausible way for countries to get on track to meeting 1.50C Paris target.

            "['MARCH 2021 What’s Ahead for a Cooperative Regulatory Agenda on Artificial Intelligence? By Meredith Broadbent In her first major speech to a U.S. audience after the U.S. presidential election, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen laid out priority areas for transatlantic cooperation. She proposed building a new relationship between Europe and the United States, one that would encompass transatlantic coordination on digital technology issues, including working together on global standards for regulating artificial intelligence (AI) aligned with EU values. A reference to cooperation on standards for AI was included in the New Transatlantic Agenda for Global Change issued by the Commission on December 2, 2020. In remarks to Parliament on January 22, 2021, President von der Leyen called for “creating a digital economy rule book” with the United States that is “valid worldwide.” Some would say Europe’s new outreach on issues of tech governance and the suggestion of establishing an “EU-U.S. Trade and Technology Council” is incongruous to the current regulatory war being waged against United States firms in the name of unilateral European tech sovereignty. On November 17, 2020, just one day before President von der Leyen’s first speech on the topic, the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released a much-awaited set of government-wide policy principles for regulating AI, which includes a call for engaging in the development of regulatory approaches through international cooperation. OMB directed agencies to initiate “dialogues” to promote compatible regulatory approaches to AI and to promote U.S. AI innovation, while protecting privacy, civil rights, civil liberties, and U.S. values. Such discussions, the guidance says, “can provide valuable opportunities to share best practices, data, and lessons learned, and ensure that the United States remains at the forefront of AI development. They can also minimize the risk of unnecessary regulatory divergences from risk-based approaches implemented by key U.S. trading partners.” When contemplating the future of AI, U.S. regulators in both Democratic and Republican administrations have shown deference to using existing regulatory frameworks where possible and for developing voluntary standards of responsibility that are drafted through public engagement, with the professed', 'goal of improving the quality of life in an ethical manner that guards against bias, promotes fairness, and protects privacy. Compared with energetic tech-skeptic trends in Europe, U.S. government officials display a certain humility and restraint in trying to regulate new technologies too soon before they are understood or even imagined. The U.S. view is that innovation will flourish in a transparent and predictable regulatory environment with benefits weighed against costs in the process of developing the rules. There are a small number of catastrophic risks, such as maintaining security of self-driving car networks or the electrical grid, which could require ex-ante regulation, but the numbers of these cases are relatively small and are better addressed through narrow, specific regulations rather than sweeping generalized rules. Technology leaders in many fields agree: looming global challenges, such as developing methods to reduce plastic in the oceans, finding a vaccine to treat the next looming pandemic, stemming emissions that cause climate change, and finding safe navigation methods for self-driving cars, will be tackled through new innovative AI and machine learning tools. Solving these urgent challenges will be done best with the benefit of multilateral perspectives, collaborative research, and less fragmentation of technology regulation along national lines. The United States and Europe, which both face the same threat of growing authoritarian dominance of the internet by China, could build a valuable strategic partnership that would support the scaling of AI capabilities of Western economies. Unfortunately, the array of tech sovereignty legislation working its way through the European Commission appears to be pivoting Europe away from the United States in a dramatic manner, making this outreach by President von der Leyen all the more timely for U.S. policymakers to consider. Both sides of the Atlantic need to work hard to bridge a more compatible center of regulatory ambition for AI if the innovation ecosystem in Europe is to continue to grow dynamically and the West is to maintain its strategic leadership in AI vis à vis China. Overview of the EU White Paper on AI The European Union has embarked on putting in place an aggressive regulatory regime for AI, through ex-ante regulatory procedures that require government permission upfront before innovative technologies are deployed. There is widespread concern that the Commission’s approach is overly prescriptive and too generalized and that AI has too many applications and forms for a one-size-fits-all regulation. On February 19, 2020, the European Commission published a white paper, On Artificial Intelligence - A European approach to excellence and trust. The white paper provides a foundation for legislative proposals expected in the first quarter of 2021. This white paper and related documents communicate a sense of distrust of new AI technologies and an urgent desire to insert government control in an effort to stem anticipated and unforeseen dangers. Following the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) model of moving first with comprehensive regulation, the Commission is taking aim at being the preeminent “global-standards setter” in the area of artificial intelligence. The Commission is convinced that international cooperation on AI matters must be based on an approach that promotes the respect of fundamental rights, including human dignity, pluralism, inclusion, nondiscrimination, and protection of privacy and personal data, and it will strive to export its values across the world. — From On Artificial Intelligence white paper What’s Ahead for a Cooperative Regulatory Agenda on Artificial Intelligence | 2', 'The documents make clear that the European Union views privacy and user rights as fundamental to AI regulation, that it seeks to lead global regulatory efforts in the AI space, and that it sees regulation as a way to capitalize on its strong competitive position in B2B industries while shoring up Europe’s weakness in developing large online digital platforms. The fundamental conviction that a regulatory framework will boost Europe as an innovation leader in the data economy—while unsubstantiated—seems to clearly pervade the Commission’s consideration of new legislation. In light of the AI white paper, it appears that the Commission is moving forward with broad, horizontal, and relatively intrusive regulation of AI applications. Ex-ante conformity assessments to control access to the EU market for AI applications originating outside of the EU are proposed. The Commission is also considering data quality and traceability requirements that would require non-EU firms to train AI applications on GDPR compliant data as a condition of market access in the European Union. Sectors that will likely be impacted by EU regulation of AI are healthcare, transportation/autos and parts producers, energy, services that rely on consumer data, the public sector, and more. To complement the AI white paper, the European Commission released a set of documents on the regulation of AI, including: 1. Communication on a European Strategy for Data, in which the Commission outlined the importance of data for economic development and the decision to invest in High Impact Projects to fund “AI ecosystems” related to the development of data spaces and cloud services; 2. Shaping Europe’s Digital Future, in which the Commission itemized all key actions to be undertaken by the European Union in order to ease data flow across the Union while enacting proper regulation to maintain the strength of democratic institutions and free-market competition, especially in developing sectors such as AI and cryptocurrency; and 3. Report on the Safety and Liability Implications of AI, the Internet of Things and Robotics, in which the Commission reviews gaps in product safety legislation that do not adequately address risks such as cyberattacks due to connectivity, autonomous behaviors of products, faulty data, opacity of algorithmic systems, software updates, and complex safety management and value chains. Of the four major documents, the AI white paper has attracted the most interest from stakeholders. Many are concerned that the Commission’s regulatory vision will be burdensome, unworkable, and have the result of suppressing the success of European digital start-ups and the innovation ecosystem in Europe. Digital rights groups, for their part, have raised alarm over the Commission’s decision to not include a proposal for a three to five-year moratorium on facial recognition technology in the white paper. The United States and Europe, which both face the same threat of growing authoritarian dominance of the internet by China, could build a valuable strategic partnership that would support the scaling of AI capabilities of Western economies. Goals of the Commission as Set Out in the AI White Paper In the white paper, the Commission supports a regulatory and investment-oriented approach to promote the uptake of and address the risks associated with certain uses of AI. To achieve these objectives, Meredith Broadbent | 3', 'the Commission proposes an “Ecosystem of Excellence” and an “Ecosystem of Trust” that emphasize the importance of working with member states to invest in research to develop AI and improve EU competitiveness. The Commission lays out a future regulatory framework for the European Union when dealing with the developing technology of AI. This framework takes a multifaceted approach to the emerging technology, proposing ways to make AI ac\n",

            "['Problem 1: “Arms Race” Framing is Winner-Takes-All Interpreting U.S.-China AI development as an “arms race” or a winner-takes-all competition fundamentally misunderstands the transnational nature of AI development and technological interdependence. Policy prescriptions drawn from this “race” concept will thus be ill-fit to the goals they attempt to serve. This bad fit could result in, among other undesirable outcomes, damage to AI development, missed opportunities for AI development, and mishandling of real AI risks. Yoshua Bengio, an early pioneer of modern AI techniques, has publicly disapproved of framing AI development as a race. “We could collectively participate in a race,” he told MIT Technology Review, “but as a scientist and somebody who wants to think about the common good, I think we’re better off thinking about how to build smarter machines and make sure AI is used for the well-being of as many people as possible.”7 Possible idealism aside, his point strikes at a fundamental flaw with this arms race analogy: AI is developed by a vast community of scientists, developers, and researchers who are not isolated within their respective countries. As such, the development of AI is not siloed within Chinese or American borders, and the benefits of artificial intelligence are not exclusive to either of those nations. Public and private entities in both countries can benefit from developments of artificial intelligence in areas that have wide reach between nations and positive impacts on economic growth and public well-being (e.g., skin cancer detection). In other words, the development of artificial intelligence is not winner-takes-all. And contrary to what some commentators seem to believe (or at least constantly and singularly discuss), not every significant application of AI will be a weapon. Graham Webster eloquently provides context on this fact through his analysis of winner-takes-all U.S.-China rhetoric. “Unlike the US and USSR, in which science and technology developed on largely independent tracks, the US and China are part of a globally intertwined ecosystem,” he explains. As a result, “companies and innovators in both countries would suffer if international research, development, and manufacturing were to shut down,” and “even if the US and China cut off trade with each other, both countries would still have to worry about security risks from components, since risks along the supply chain exist everywhere.”8 There is far more interconnection and interdependence than may otherwise be apparent in an “arms race” framing. American firms rely heavily on Chinese manufacturing technologies (e.g., in Shenzhen),9 and that reliance is likely to grow as artificial intelligence applications made in the United States are increasingly deployed in drones, robots, and the like which may depend upon Chinese-made hardware. Trade and supply-chain links aid both countries in further developing artificial intelligence. newamerica.org/cybersecurity-initiative/reports/essay-reframing-the-us-china-ai-arms-race/ 7', '10 China is a major market for U.S. AI hardware, and researchers from around the world—including between China and the United States—might work on similar AI problems, share data used to develop AI systems, or coauthor research papers. 11 All of these factors further bolster the interconnections between the two countries’ AI sectors. As is perhaps expected, money, too, has an impact. In 2013, Chinese investment in Silicon Valley was at $1.17 billion. By 2015, it was $11.52 billion.12 From 2012 to 2016, American firms had invested $2.6 billion in the other direction.13 While Chinese venture capitalists have invested heavily in U.S. tech companies like Uber and Airbnb,14 Tencent and Alibaba—both tech giants in China—are themselves multinational public corporations with significant ownership by international stakeholders.15 Worth noting is that both companies have extensive ties to the Communist Party of China (CCP) and the Chinese government, and are currently subject to Chinese laws mandating information-sharing with the government (e.g., via the 2017 Cybersecurity Law).16 But even this considered, there is notable economic interconnection and interdependence between AI development in the two states. Interconnections and interdependencies between AI development in the United States and AI development in China don’t end there. China’s Tsinghua University opened an Institute for Artificial Intelligence in June 2018, for which Google’s AI Chief Jeff Dean is an advisor.17 Alibaba, another Chinese tech giant, has multiple research labs located in the United States as part of its global AI research efforts. 18 China’s largest retailer has a research partnership with Stanford University’s Artificial Intelligence Lab to fund such research areas as computer vision, robotics, machine learning, forecasting, and natural language processing.19 Kai- Fu Lee, former head of Google’s operations in China, runs an AI training institution in the country that leverages the expertise of Chinese government personnel and some of North America’s “leading” computer scientists.20 And Baidu, the Chinese search company, belongs to the U.S.-based Partnership for AI, which aims to develop best practices for AI technology.21 It is worth noting potential risks associated with these kinds of relationships, including the Chinese government’s intentions to bring Western technology talent from the United States into its own country22 and previous instances of intellectual property theft. But that still doesn’t change the existence of collaborative relationships and the value garnered from at least some of them. The United States and China have many interconnections and interdependencies between their AI sectors—and so the key is in managing the risks that result therefrom, not denying the interconnectivity and interdependence in the first place. The “AI arms race” framing implies isolated competition between two global powers, which is clearly inaccurate when it comes to the United States and China; their AI development is anything but isolated from one another. Ideally, the “openness that is so integral to American innovation should be sustained and newamerica.org/cybersecurity-initiative/reports/essay-reframing-the-us-china-ai-arms-race/ 8', 'safeguarded”23 rather than building walls between American and Chinese AI development.24 But as a result of this winner-takes-all framing, a growing emphasis on a winner-takes-all race threatens to push the two countries’ tech sectors apart, potentially damaging AI development in ways we can’t foresee. It doesn’t matter what exactly initialized this way of thinking—for instance, some would argue this is a reaction to China’s aggressive push for AI supremacy in many areas25—because this is the reality. This bad fit could result in, among other undesirable outcomes, damage to AI development, missed opportunities for AI development, and mishandling of real AI risks. As a result of this winner-takes-all view of AI development, mutually damaging U.S. policies towards China—like reckless trade policies or trying to hamper all collaboration on AI whatsoever—may very well hurt American AI development,26 not to mention play into Beijing’s vision of “science as a tool of national greatness and scientists as servants to the state.”27 The Trump administration’s recent talk of limiting the “export of artificial intelligence”28 is just one recent example. This winner-takes-all, race-to-the-bottom approach, which Remco Zwetsloot, Helen Toner, and Jeffrey Ding argue is guided heavily by fear and speculation,29 could further compromise the likelihood of developing sound policies that can advance mutual interests—while not lending too much advantage to Chinese AI capabilities.30 In addition to crafting hurtful policies and missing opportunities to advance mutual interests, United States policymakers, as a result of the AI arms race framing, may mishandle AI risks. An increasingly common refrain, for instance, is that any privacy regulation in the United States is going to doom AI development because Chinese competitors face no restrictions on their data collection. This argument risks exploiting individuals’ information, by which American data privacy legislation—which is desperately needed—is guided by what the Chinese government has or has not done in the same vein.31 American companies can still remain competitive in the AI sector while working under the guidance of some form of national privacy regulation. Even generally, total disengagement with China on issues of AI ethics is not preferable either. It is well known and oft-discussed that Chinese society has different views than American society on such issues as data privacy.32 According to the executive director at Partnership for AI, “we cannot have a comprehensive and global conversation on AI development unless China has a seat at the table.” 33 But with the AI arms race framing, U.S. policymakers may very well damage American AI development, miss opportunities for bolstering it, and dismiss or ignore ethical issues that need addressing under the belief of winner-takes-all AI competition. newamerica.org/cybersecurity-initiative/reports/essay-reframing-the-us-china-ai-arms-race/ 9', 'Reframing AI Competition & Conclusion We are in an era of great power competition, and the United States and China are undoubtedly in competition with respect to artificial intelligence.

            "['POLICY BRIEF MACHINE POLITICS: EUROPE AND THE AI REVOLUTION Ulrike Franke & Paola Sartori July 2019 SUMMARY France, Germany, and Italy plan to adopt national and European goals on AI, albeit for different reasons. France’s AI strategy appears to be driven by the conviction that, in addition to creating risks, AI presents opportunities for the economy and society. In contrast, the German – and, to the extent that one can infer, Italian – approach to AI is markedly driven by fear of losing economic opportunities. While the French strategy includes a focus on the military and security elements of AI, its German counterpart almost completely neglects this area. The EU appears to be largely uninterested in AI’s geopolitical importance, but its member states can only influence the global development of AI if they act together.', 'Introduction Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely expected to become vital to just about everything. It is changing the economy, affecting the ways in which people shop, communicate, and conduct research. It is difficult to think of activities that the implementation of AI cannot speed up, improve, or otherwise change. Investment bank Goldman Sachs calls AI “a needle-moving technology for the global economy ... impacting every corporation, industry, and segment of the economy in time” [1] AI is not just another technology; it is an enabler that some analysts have likened to the combustion engine or electricity – which caused revolutions no country could afford to disregard. Governments have increasingly come to share this conviction and are now looking for the best ways to help national economies deal with AI. They are trying to prepare companies, labour markets, and societies for the expected disruption; they aim to facilitate world-class research and provide training that will prepare citizens for the world of the future. Governments’ weapon of choice in this battle? The national AI strategy. Across Europe, governments are either writing or have already published national strategies on how best to support the development and application of AI. The European Union’s AI strategy, called the “Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence”, asks its member states to put in place national AI strategies or programmes by mid-2019. So far, at least seven EU member states – Belgium, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom – and the Nordic-Baltic region have published such strategies. At least ten others – Austria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Italy, Latvia, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia, and Spain – are in the process of writing them. But how to formulate such a strategy? What should governments focus on, given that AI promises (or threatens) to change so much? How do states choose where to concentrate their efforts and what to leave out? This policy brief assesses the national AI strategies of France and Germany, as well as Italy’s recently published “ Proposals for an Italian AI Strategy” and other official documents that pertain to AI and technology generally, to understand these countries’ priorities on AI. It Machine politics: Europe and the AI revolution – ECFR/ECFR/292 2', 'focuses on the strategies because they are likely to define the states’ approaches to AI. The paper concentrates on two main issues. Firstly, it examines the role of European cooperation, especially the emphasis the three countries place on working with EU institutions and other member states to tackle the challenges of AI and take advantage of the opportunities it offers. Understanding these challenges and opportunities is key to shaping the EU’s approach to AI. Seeing its role as one of coordination, the union has chosen the development of “ethical AI” as its main mission in this. But the EU can only play such a role if member states believe that working with their European neighbours, as well as the union’s institutions, will be beneficial to their AI efforts. Secondly, the paper examines the extent to which their strategies deal with the role of AI in defence and security. AI is widely expected to have a major influence on the future of warfare. The United States and China have already made significant investments in the development of AI-enabled weapons. As this could have major implications for defence capabilities, strategic stability, and geopolitics more broadly, it is important to identify where Europe – whose public debate on military AI has been relatively muted – stands on the issue. What is AI? “Artificial intelligence” (AI) is an ill-defined term, not least because its meaning has changed over time. It generally refers to efforts to build computers and machines able to perform actions that one would expect to require human intelligence, such as reasoning and decision-making. At various points in time, there has been a widespread expectation that the emergence of “real AI” – comparable to human intelligence – was imminent. However, after scientists created systems that could perform tasks once thought to be the preserve of humans, AI came to be defined by even more complex tasks. One way to conceive of AI is as a shift from humans telling computers how to act, to computers learning how to act. The creation of Machine politics: Europe and the AI revolution – ECFR/ECFR/292 3', 'systems that are capable of this depends mostly on the application of machine learning techniques – at the moment, particularly so-called “deep learning” and neural networks. Currently, most AI applications are “narrow”, focusing on one specific task rather than “general”, capable of reproducing human-level intelligence. In fact, most current narrow AI is “brittle”, as it fails when confronted with tasks that even slightly differ from its training. Given the various possible applications of AI, it is misleading to think of AI as a stand-alone capability or one application of technology. Instead, it is more helpful to view AI as an enabler and thus speak of systems such as “AI- enabled financial trading” or “AI-enabled cyber defences”. Three countries, three approaches: How to write a national AI strategy France has shown considerable interest in AI in recent years. The country has made the technology a priority at the highest level, with President Emmanuel Macron discussing the topic at length in a widely read Wired interview in 2018 (two years after Barack Obama, then US president, participated in a similar interview with the magazine). In March 2017, the French education and research ministry published “France AI”, a report that included recommendations from expert working groups. The document was followed a year later by 152-page strategy “For a Meaningful Artificial Intelligence – Towards a French and European Strategy”, published simultaneously in French and English. While it was commissioned by the government, the French strategy was written by a team led by Cédric Villani, one of France’s AI stars and a member of parliament for La République en Marche! As a result, the strategy is more ambitious than a governmental or ministerial publication would have been. It is also more targeted: the report explicitly aims to avoid spreading state efforts too thinly, identifying four sectors in which French industry “can seriously envisage playing a leading role at [the] global level and compete with non-European giants” and in which public money should be spent. These sectors are health, transport and mobility, the Machine politics: Europe and the AI revolution – ECFR/ECFR/292 4', 'environment, and defence and security. The strategy is detailed and coherent in strengthening French and European AI efforts. It focuses on the availability of data for AI, arguing that the authorities should make data “a common good” by granting researchers access to information from government-funded projects and by incentivising private companies to publish their data. The strategy states that French academic research is at the forefront of global developments in mathematics and AI, but that the country’s scientific progress “does not always translate into concrete industrial and economic applications”. It recommends tripling the number of people trained in AI in France in the next three years. To achieve this, it also advocates for “hefty salary top-ups” and a considerable reduction in related administrative tasks in research institutions and universities. The strategy also discusses AI’s impact on the labour market, the development of ecological AI, and ethics and diversity issues in AI. It recommends that France create a digital technology and AI ethics committee that is open to society and promotes public education. The strategy has a generally upbeat tone; while it does not neglect the dangers of AI, it calls it “one of the most fascinating scientific endeavors of our time” and notes that “in recent years, artificial intelligence has entered a new era, which gives rise to many hopes”. Villani, in his foreword to the strategy, speaks about his personal enthusiasm for AI and expresses its authors’ conviction that “France – and Europe as a whole – must act synergistically, with confidence and determination, to become part of the emerging AI revolution”. Although it was not written by policymakers, the strategy appears to have been drafted with a geopolitical mindset. Its authors reference Russian president Vladimir Putin’s now famous statement that “whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world” and comment on the strategic importance of AI. And it is on the geopolitical level that the strategy sounds the alarm, adding that “France and Europe can already be regarded as ‘cybercolonies’ in many aspects”. For Germany, last year was also important. Having been criticised as slow to address AI issues, the German authorities noticeably sped up their activities in the Machine politics: Europe and the AI revolution – ECFR/ECFR/292 5', 'area in 2018.

Actor: AI Programs and Profiles 1.1 Introduction Despite the fact that technological landscapes are subject to unpredictable disruption,19 this study aims to assess future trajectories and likely impact of the use of AI technologies 5-10 years into the future. It does so by looking at the likely manifestation of AI-related threats and opportunities on the basis of case studies covering four actors; namely: the united States, China, russia, and the Eu-28.20 These actors’ perspectives and preferences on the utility of these technologies are informing their national AI programs and their positions on standards and norms regulating AI applications.21 An analysis of these trend setters’ profiles and programs within the field is consequently conducive not only to understanding which threats and opportunities are likely to contribute to in the coming 5-10 years, but also to understanding which threats and opportunities are likely to be mitigated by forthcoming (international) regulatory frameworks. This chapter first provides a brief explanation of the method used in the comparative benchmark of the country profiles and programs. For the readers solely interested in the research findings, these are presented on page 20 and onwards. The chapter follows with the analysis of the four case studies, offers a comparative assessment of the four profiles and a high-level overview of the threats and opportunities identified in the case studies. 1.2 Method In general terms, the relative competitiveness of a state’s AI ecosystem can be understood as deriving from a combination of the scale of its existing (AI-relevant) 19 Julie rennecker and Lindsey Godwin, “Delays and Interruptions: A Self-Perpetuating Paradox of Communication Technology use,” Information and Organization 15, no. 3 (2005): 247–266, https://doi.org/10/dwc3gz. 20 The authors acknowledge the relevance that private-sector actors’ use of AI-related technologies has on geopolitics, but stipulate that measures taken towards the mitigation (or utilization of) the threats and/or opportunities these corporations’ activities present can be conceptualized as comprising a part of nation states’ strategies to realize (or prevent) geopolitical outcomes. As such, the strategic coherence section of the country profiling rubric incorporates questions relating to state regulation and/or cooperation with (read utilization of) private-sector actors. 21 John McCarthy and Patrick J. Hayes, “Some Philosophical Problems from the Standpoint of Artificial Intelligence,” in Readings in Artificial Intelligence (Elsevier, 1981), 431–450. 24 HCSS Report', 'infrastructure22 and from the policy and/or organizational framework which has been put in place to utilize it. Within the context of this study, infrastructure is constituting ‘inert’ (AI-relevant) resources which can be stitched together into a robust AI ecosystem through the introduction of coherent legislation. Within the context of this study, the infrastructure component of the country’s scoring exercise is conceptualized as being contingent on the existence of resources which facilitate: a) the harvesting and/or generation of large reams of data, referred to as digitization; b) the speedy processing and/or analysis thereof, referred to as data processing potential; c) the development of innovative and/or utile algorithms, referred to as innovation infrastructure. The absence of any of these three factors negatively impacts a nation’s ability to develop cutting-edge AI and to apply it towards geopolitically-relevant outcomes.23 The development of sophisticated and/or widely applicable AI algorithms is entirely contingent on AI developers’ access to a.) the human resources24 necessary to code them, and b.) a large volume of data upon which to train the resulting algorithms.25 In concrete terms, this means that sophisticated AI cannot emerge in the absence of large-scale r&D activities and data availability.26 Simultaneously, the presence of infrastructure which facilitates data processing is of relevance within the context of geopolitically-impactful AI not only because it constitutes a prerequisite for data harvesting but because it is key to unlocking some of the technology’s more cutting-edge use cases.27 Even if a large volume of data is harvested, its use within the context of training algorithms will be limited in the absence of the computing power necessary to analyze it. As an example, the use of AI to analyze data in real-time - an application which facilitates the development of sophisticated forecasting models, and which can drastically improve state agencies’ reactive capabilities - constitutes a computationally intensive process in which data needs not only to be ‘cleaned’ and processed in real time, but also to be analyzed.28 22 read: supercomputers, data centers, education programs, universities offering AI-relevant studies, etc. 23 Darrell M.

Macro Implications of Micro Transformations 25', 'As previously alluded to, the mere presence of infrastructure conducive to the building of a robust AI ecosystem does not guarantee its productivity.29 Within the context of the country scoring exercise, which is incorporated in this research, this notion is operationalized by means of the strategic coherence variable, which assesses to what degree the four actors, facilitate, and/or guide AI-related activities internally. National governments play an important role not only in ensuring effective utilization of the infrastructure and/or resources which are present but also in ensuring favorable conditions continue to exist.30 This is true not only within the context of achieving geopolitical outcomes through the application of AI-related technologies, but also within the context of circumventing the manifestation of negative externalities.31 As an example, the European union’s GDPr regulation32 - which limits what data private sector entities can collect (and how they can use it) - constitutes a clear instance of a government intervention which is geared towards mitigating the impact of a negative externality (in this case, the sociopolitical issue of political and/ or societal polarization) brought on by private-sector use of AI.33 Government policy, however may also negatively impact the competitiveness of a state’s AI ecosystem.34 For example, constraints on private-sector data collection or on the employment of international workers may hamstring the productivity and range of possible applications developed by a state’s AI ecosystem.35 The frameworks for analyzing infrastructure and strategic coherency are outlined in the paragraphs below. 1.2.1 Digitization The digitization component of the country scoring framework is geared towards operationalizing a state’s potential for generating and harvesting big data.36 At the highest possible level, ‘big data’ sources can thus be conceptualized as operationalizing either the activities of individuals (as is the case with social media data & government data, as well as some types of IoT-and-commercially-sourced data), or dynamics within the physical environment (as is the case with some types of IoT, commercial, and social media-sourced data).

Promises and perils of artificial intelligence for strategic stability and nuclear risk management: Euro-Atlantic perspectives vincent boulanin This edited volume is the first instalment of a trilogy that explores regional perspectives and trends related to the impact that recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) could have on nuclear weapons and doctrines, strategic stability, and international security generally. It assembles the views of 14 experts from the Euro-Atlantic community who participated in a workshop on the topic organized by SIPRI in May 2018 in Stockholm. This final chapter presents the key conclusions that can be drawn from this collection of essays. It first gathers the contributors’ views on what the current AI renaissance offers and the risks that it brings (in section I). It then assesses what can be concluded about the impact of AI in the field of nuclear weapons and doctrines (in section II). Finally (in section III), it closes the volume by reviewing the options for dealing with the risks that accompany the conjunction of AI and nuclear weapons. I. The promises and perils of the current AI renaissance A nuanced understanding of the technology and associated risks is a precondition for an appropriate policy response Getting the risk picture right As a number of authors hint in their essays, it is easy to misconceive the opportunities and challenges posed by AI in the military domain in general and the nuclear domain in particular. The field of AI is going through a high-profile renaissance. There is a growing number of news articles, publications and public events that attempt to analyse the components of what the current success of the AI renaissance is—that is, a breakthrough in the area of machine learning that has unlocked major opportunities for the development of AI applications, such as autonomous systems. Nevertheless, there are enduring misconceptions about the possibilities and risks that AI could actually raise in the near term in the military sphere. As Frank Sauer notes (chapter 10), ‘AI and machine learning are still simultaneously over- and underestimated by both the general public and policymakers’. One of the reasons why they are being overestimated is the terminology, which triggers anthropomorphic representations. For Sauer, ‘the “intelligence” component of the term AI evokes the wrong association, namely with human learning and human intelligence’, which ‘both differ significantly from the nature of AI and machine learning and what they are currently capable of’.', '132 the impact of ai on strategic stability and nuclear risk The present author also flags this terminological problem in the introduction to AI and machine learning (chapter 2): ‘the way in which machine learning works has nothing to do with the way humans learn’. This discrepancy between human and machine intelligence and learning is clearly illustrated by the technical descriptions of how machine learning and autonomous systems work by Dimitri Scheftelowitsch (chapter 3) and Martin Hagström (chapter 4). A second reason why the potential of AI is overestimated is the lack of awareness about the multiple technical and operational problems that slow down the adoption by the military of machine learning applications and autonomous systems. The first problem is the limitation of the technology itself. In his essay on the state of autonomous systems, Scheftelowitsch writes that, for many tasks and operating environment, ‘the design of an autonomous system that can be used in practice is a considerable engineering, mathematical and political challenge. The reasons for this lie not necessarily in the autonomous decision-making as such, since it is often easy to provide an appropriate mathematical model, but in the various other, not necessarily technical, aspects of autonomy.’ The state of the art, while impressive, still trails a long way behind the cultural perception of what autonomous systems ought to be able to do in a military context, namely operate safely and reliably in complex, uncertain and adversarial environment. A number of contributors underline that state autonomous systems are still too brittle, to reuse Michael Horowitz’s words (chapter 9). Hagström also notes that, while advances in machine learning could improve the design of autonomous systems as well as offering qualitative improvement to a large variety of military applications, they also generate unique problems in terms of system predictability and reliability. He underlines that a characteristic of the models created by machine learning is that they are not transparent: their behaviour may therefore not be fully understandable and predictable to the humans who design and use them—which is problematic in a military context since ‘From an operational point of view, the effects of a weapon system must be predictable to the commanding officer’. For Hagström, there is therefore an important gap to be filled between what machine learning can do at the experimental level and what it can be trusted to do when actually deployed; to be able to exploit the advances of machine learning, the military will first have to solve some complex testing and verification problems. There are, in other words, many reasons not to exaggerate the impact of the current AI renaissance on the military. The contributions in this volume illustrate that AI could enable major qualitative improvement in many areas of warfare; however, foreseeable developments will be far more prosaic than the common representation of military AI in popular culture. Superintelligent AI or Terminator-like autonomous systems are not the type of technology that policymakers and the general public should worry about. Rather, they should be concerned by the fact that the military might underestimate or disregard the limitations of current AI technology.', 'promises and perils of ai for strategic stability 133 The contributors present a fairly similar diagnosis of the limitations of current AI technology. Together, they point towards four factors. 1. The brittleness of AI. AI technology is limited to extremely narrow tasks. In Sauer’s words, it may ‘[fail] spectacularly when confronted with a task [or environment] that differs slightly from what it was trained for’. 2. The opacity and unpredictability of machine learning. Machine learning-based systems may generate unexplainable outputs and unpredictable behaviours. 3. The bias embedded in the systems. AI systems, including systems trained by machine learning, may include human bias that can have detrimental effects, particularly when these systems are intended to support critical human decisions, such as a decision to use force. 4. The vulnerability of AI systems. As thoroughly demonstrated by Shahar Avin and S. M. Amadae (chapter 13), the integration of AI into military systems not only increases their potential vulnerability to cyberattack (by increasing the ‘attack surface’ as they put it) but also makes possible new types of attack, for instance spoofing involving data poisoning. Take time to explore the technology-based risks before deployment With these limitations in mind, nearly all the contributors warn that an immature adoption of the newest development in AI technology by the military, particularly in the context of nuclear weapon systems, could have dramatic consequences. They seem to agree that it would be prudent for states to devote time and resources to understanding these limitations and how they can be mitigated early in the research and development process. However, as Page Stoutland notes (chapter 7), ‘The potential performance benefits . . . may prove irresistible to developers and government sponsors’. This concern seems to be shared by other contributors, including Sauer and Justin Bronk. They note that some states might be ready to lower their system safety and reliability standards in order to maintain or develop their technological edge over their competitors. Speaking from a British and European perspective, Bronk concludes in his essay on unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) and autonomous weapons (chapter 12) that ‘Potential adversary powers (and most probably the USA) will not wait for West European powers to make up their mind before making lethal, highly autonomous aircraft’. For Bronk, European states, and the United Kingdom in particular, have a key role to play in influencing ‘the construction of norms around these systems’. The exploration of the risks and policy options needs to be inclusive Beyond alliances States need to not only develop and better understanding the opportunities and challenges posed by the military use of AI, particularly in the nuclear force-related context; they also need to discuss these with other states. Bronk hints that one way', '134 the impact of ai on strategic stability and nuclear risk to start this discussion is to engage with like-minded states. From the perspective of Western countries, that would mean engaging in a conversation within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) or the European Union (EU). While it would certainly be beneficial if Western countries could agree on the risk diagnosis or preferable policy response, that would not be enough. The discussion on the risks and norms that could govern the use of AI in the military sphere in general—and in the nuclear context in particular—also needs to take place between NATO member states, Russia and other nuclear-armed states such as China and India. There are a number of ongoing arms control discussion tracks that provide opportunities for such discussions: the process on lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS) under the 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW Convention) for issues related to conventional use of military AI and, for nuclear-related concerns, the review process of the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).

ABSTRACT: This study was conducted in collaboration with Henrich Böll Stiftung (hbs). The study aims to find out people’s perception about environmental issues, their impacts on daily life leading to environment a determinant for people to vote? A questionnaire consisting of 10 closed-ended questions was developed. n About 91% of the respondents said that high temperature is an issue followed by 87% who added that water shortage is one of the key environmental issues. However, only 13% of the respondents voted for environment keeping it as a determinant. This shows that environment is a key issue but is not a priority. Keywords: Environment, Water, Temperature, Air Pollution, Trees, Political Parties, Government and Pakistan 2. INTRODUCTION: This perception survey analyzes Pakistan’s environmental vulnerability against 10 indicators based on Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) parameters. Pakistan has a poor performance with a decreasing forest cover due to discrepancy in plantation and deforestation measures, losing up to 42,000 ha per year (1.66%). Currently, Pakistan’s forest cover is an abysmal 1.9% (of land cover), which is the lowest among the countries in the region. The country actually lost 840,000 ha or 33.2% of its forest cover during 1990 and 2010. On the count of water resources, Pakistan has gone from being water surplus to water stressed and soon it is going to have water scarcity. The per capita water availability has reduced from approximately 5000 cubic meters per year to around 1000 cubic meters per year. Wastage of water continues both by domestic and industrial consumers. Pakistan is expected to experience increased variability of river flows due to increased variability of precipitation and melting of glaciers. Demand for irrigation water may increase due to higher evaporation rates. Yields of wheat and basmati rice are expected to decline and may drive production northward, subject to water availability. Water availability for hydropower generation may decline. Hotter temperatures are likely to increase energy demand due to increased air conditioning requirements. Warmer air and water temperatures may decrease efficiency of nuclear and thermal power plant generation. Mortality due to extreme heatwaves may increase. Urban drainage systems may be further stressed by high rainfall and flash floods. Sea level rise and storm surges may adversely affect coastal infrastructure and livelihoods 1 . In last few years, air pollution has increased manifold in Pakistan. For example, Lahore, the provincial capital of the Punjab province, witnessed extreme visibility and health issues in the form of smog. According to readings, an air monitoring level of carbon monoxide went as high as 21.29 milligram per metre in one of the main and high populated areas in the city. The life of locals was stranded. However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies that could indicate the smog composition. 1Zaman, Q.U., Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2017. Climate Change Profile of Pakistan. Accessed on 12th June, 2018. https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/357876/climate-change-profile-pakistan.pdf 1', 'According to Climate Vulnerability Risk Index 2016, Pakistan is ranked 7th most vulnerable country in a long run due to climate change. German Watch, a think tank based in Germany, ranked Pakistan the 40th on the list with having suffered 566 casualties, and losing US $47.313 million — equivalent to 0.0048 per cent of the GDP. This also means that its natural resources are under stress and can result in making the country and its future generations further vulnerable to climate change because Pakistan economy is largely based on agriculture. The economic progress of the country will be at stake if adequate measures are not taken. In Pakistan, extreme weather events are increasing; the super floods of 2010 affected around 20 million people. In 2011, five years of rainfall fell in just 4 weeks in Sindh. In 2012, Pakistan again faced heavy floods. These events show that climate change is a reality with devastating consequences in the country. The last few years of continuous flooding in the country has had a long-term impact on farmers’ ability to produce crops. The above stresses and resource depletion require effective governance especially around the above-mentioned 10 indicators. The leadership in the country is preoccupied with political and security issues and do not consider environment a part and parcel of development 2. The livelihood of people is directly connected to the natural resources and also to environmental sustainability. The government, however, has taken initiatives to reduce risk of flash floods in Northern Pakistan, particularly glacial lakes outburst floods (GLOFs). Similarly, local communities improved livelihoods by repairing water channels in Sindh.

Over the years, where the world is badly affected by environmental changes, Pakistan has its own story. Climate is constantly changing due to anthropogenic activities. Global warming is known in many countries but Pakistan is a place where it got attention in the year 2010 when heatwave created a mess and impacted badly especially the poor people. After this recorded high temperature in the year 2015, death toll in the country increased. Karachi was the area where most of the people died due to high temperatures which prevailed there for weeks (Saleem et al. 2018). Therefore, in the current survey, 96% of the respondents from Sindh province highlighted ‘high temperature’ as the top environment issues as it impacted their health, day-to-day life besides impacting the economy. Owing to lack of mitigation measures (by the government) and resources, people still couldn’t adapt to the high temperatures that causes deaths every year. As many as 65 people died in Karachi due to high temperatures this year’s summer (The Guardian 2018). The poor, women and children are most vulnerable to the high temperatures because of fragile health conditions and sensitivity towards high temperatures. According to the New York Times (2018), the 8', 'highest temperature ever recorded in the history of Pakistan was 50.2 degrees Celsius in Nawab Shah, Sindh (The New York Times 2018). This high temperature not only affects human health but also has devastating impact on the economy. The second top environmental issue, according to the respondents, is water shortage. According to United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Pakistan will run dry by the year 2025 ‘if’ mismanagement continues. According to the research, reduced water quantity and quality is because of climate change (Rees and Collins 2005). This threat is bigger than terrorism as Pakistan is heavily dependent on agricultural economy. Respondents from th\n",

The discussion will first explore accommodation practices related to population dynamics and environmental changes, particularly with a view to examining how local communities attempt to maintain a relative balance between population and resources. This will be followed by an inquiry into livelihood adjustments. The key issues for investigation are: What livelihood options have been available in the research sites and how are they utilized? Are there more sustainable resource utilization practices being adopted, given environmental and demographic changes? Other additional conceptual questions include: What is meant by \"local\"? What are its social and spatial characteristics? Who responds, to what extent, and to what effect? Should there be a specific time frame? Any attempt to answer these questions satisfactorily would require an exhaustive, comparative study carried out over a long period of time. The scope of the present study is limited to exploring the experiences of the local communities in the case study areas.', 'Population Dynamics and Environment Costa Rica Costa Rica is generally regarded as a \"successful\" case amongst developing countries, with respect to both human and natural resources management. In this section, this assertion is scrutinized by focusing on the local level \"accommodation\" processes. We begin by analysing peoples\\' responses to population changes. Some background information on population dynamics in the case study areas has been presented in the preceding chapter. One of the salient features observed in both the Pacific and Atlantic zones is the low rate of population growth, around 2 percent annum. In certain locations, nearly 50 percent of women in the child-bearing age bracket practise family planning methods. The national level fertility rate has come down to 3.1 births per women (Table 2). There has also been a sharp decline in infant mortality and a rapid rise in life expectancy (ibid.). Apart from Candelarita (with the population density of 73 persons per square kilometre), all the other research sites have density rates of between 4 to 11 persons per square kilometre. These places constitute one of the areas with the lowest man-land ratio levels in the country. Migration has played an important role in changing demographic patterns. There has been a migratory flow out of Polka, while the Atlantic area has received great numbers of new residents. In most of the case study sites, the principal demographic response of the community has been the reduction in fertility. Further accommodations are made by out-migrating. However, it is difficult to establish with any precision, if these responses have been triggered primarily by population pressure or influenced by broader social and economic considerations. The existence of low level population density raises doubts on the incentives for reducing family size. It seems certain, though, that improved education and healthcare supplied people with wider choices. By 70', 'The Processes of Adjustment Between Population Levels, Resources, and Livelihoods reducing the size of their families, couples have sought to provide superior living conditions for themselves and their children. Local communities have reacted in varying ways to changing environmental circumstances. In the Pacific zone, it seems that the perception of many people towards the environment has changed over the past 15 years. Peasants are conscious; of the loss of soil fertility and the need for reforestation. At time, they have been more receptive to official environmental programmes. In 1979, the government declared Puriscal County an \"environmental emergency zone\", and focused on deforestation as the principal problem (Thrupp, 1981:99). The government, along with many external funding and research agencies, actively promoted tree planting programmes. Beside planting trees on the degraded \\'public\\' lands, farmers were encouraged to plant trees on their private plots. Up until 1991, some 736 hectares were \\'reforested\\' in the area. The participation of local communities in these schemes was somewhat lukewarm. In the late 1980s, the government, again supported by external aid agencies, initiated another environmental project. This involved the promotion of soil conservation and the reduction in the agro- chemical run-off on tobacco fields. This programme also initiated reforestation activities, and by the late 1980s, about 975 hectares were reforested. However, the erosion rates still remained excessively high, and the terraces and ditches reduced the agro-chemical run-off only slightly. Most peasants found the labour demand for conservation unaffordable, and some opted out of producing tobacco and moved to perennial crops. This was, to some extent, prompted by the relatively cheap loans disbursed through the EEC funded conservation programme. The decrease in firewood and timber availability has led to certain important changes in the daily lives of the villagers of Candelarita and Polka. This problem has been acute especially in Candelarita where people are increasingly required to purchase wood in the market or switch to other fuels such as electricity or 71', \"Population Dynamics and Environment gas. However, these costly options are beyond the reach of the majority of peasants. Deforestation has also led to a shortage of timber and the rise in prices. Those who can afford to buy their timber form the neighbouring town of Santiago. Timber shortage is most acutely felt by the small peasants or labourers without access to their own trees. The shade trees planted in the coffee fields have been an important source of wood for many peasant households. However, in recent years, new hybrid varieties of coffee (not needing shade to grow) are promoted through externally funded conservation programmes in order to establish perennial land use systems. The shortage of drinking water is another local level environmental issue. In Candelarita, water is piped from Santiago since 1985. In Polka, the water comes from the spring; it is stored in tanks and then piped to people's houses. In both villages, the provisioning of water by the government is the direct result of organized pressure by the community. However, during the dry months, water is still a problem in both villages. In Candelarita, women are required to line up for water early each morning. In Polka, on the other hand, the water tank is often empty. This has prompted some people to dig their own wells and others to travel to distant springs. The responses of the communities in the Atlantic zone to their environment have been marked by many contradictions and inconsistencies. As this area represents one of the dynamic agricultural frontiers, it has experienced a substantial in-migration of people in search of larger plots of land, as well as wage employment in the banana plantations. Some new residents apparently attempted to supplement their income by selling timber to logging companies. On the whole, banana cultivation has remained the main agricultural or economic activity. It has provided work for considerable numbers of people, and high foreign exchange earnings for the government (The Tico Times, 6 December 1991). The cultivation of banana has expanded very rapidly in recent years in response to external market demands. 72\", 'The Processes of Adjustment Between Population Levels, Resources, and Livelihoods Amongst the migrants, large families are in a better economic position than small families.

More than 60 countries at all levels of development (including all 27 EU member states) now have legislation, policies, directives or regulations prescribing the application of SEA, and many more are introducing it as part of their policy toolkits – although it is not necessarily used effectively and many development actors are unaware of its function, value and potential. At the UN Rio+20 conference in 2012, the emergent green economy concept was a central theme, but it was agreed that nationally (as opposed to globally) driven approaches should be the way forward, so that green economy policies can be properly tailored. Attention has therefore turned to how SEA can help in promoting a transition to green economic development. This paper provides a preliminary exploration of the links between SEA and green economy, and the role of SEA in supporting decision-making for green growth in relation to a range of entry points: government policies, plans and programmes; climate change and low-carbon growth; sustainable transport; waste management, water and sanitation; ecosystems and sustainable use of biodiversity; sustainable agriculture/food production and supply; green energy and trade. It also discusses the use of indicators in monitoring SEA and the treatment of social concerns, particularly gender. Throughout, the text is supported by case examples illustrating its application in different contexts relevant to green economy. A final section discusses a range of steps that might be taken to encourage and facilitate increased use of SEA as an environmental mainstreaming tool in support of transitioning to a green economy.

A wide array of tactics, tools and approaches for such integration is available, and the opportunities and challenges of mainstreaming the environment are discussed by Dalal-Clayton and Bass (2009) (see also www.environmental-mainstreaming.org). Strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is an umbrella term for a range of analytical and participatory approaches that aim to integrate environmental (and linked social and economic) considerations into policies, plans and programmes and assess their potential development effectiveness and sustainability. SEA has emerged over the last 20 years as one of the most prominent processes for environmental mainstreaming and is now the subject of an increasing literature (for a review of SEA-related projects and academic literature, see Fischer and Onyango 2012). Its potential to play a key role in both advancing the GE ideal and realising the MDGs is increasingly being recognised. Indeed, the International Association for Impact Assessment made “Transitioning to the Green Economy – contributions of Impact Assessment” the focus of its 2010 annual conference in Geneva11. There is growing uptake of SEA around the world: it is estimated that over 60 countries at all levels of development (including all 27 EU member states) now have legislation, policies, directives or regulations prescribing the application of SEA, and many more are introducing it as part of their policy toolkits (Sadler 2011., and B.Sadler, pers.com.). For a review of international experience of SEA, see Dalal-Clayton and Sadler (2005); and for guidance on applying SEA in the context of development cooperation, see OECD DAC (2006). In the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness adopted in 200512, donors and partner countries committed to “develop and apply common approaches for SEA at the sector and national levels” (section 41). In response, the role and potential of SEA in development cooperation was set out in guidance published by the OECD DAC (2006) (available at www.seataskteam.net), and recent experience of its application in development cooperation is described in a number of publications, eg Frey et al. (2011), Loayza (2012), OECD (2012b). An OECD policy on SEA (2008) recognises the value of SEA to: n safeguard environmental assets for sustainable poverty reduction and development; n build public engagement in decision-making; n prevent costly mistakes by alerting decision-makers to potentially unsustainable development options at an early stage in the decision-making process; n simplify project-level EIA requirements, thereby speeding up subsequent implementation of projects and programmes; and n facilitate transboundary cooperation around shared environmental resources and contribute to conflict prevention. [11] See http://www.iaia.org/iaia10/proceedings/default.aspx [12] See http://www.oecd.org/dac/effectiveness/parisdeclarationandaccraagendaforaction.htm 19', 'Fischer (2009) discusses two key roles of SEA in ‘greening’ decision-making: n Providing for ‘green’ information – through the description of the environmental baseline, the identification and evaluation of different options in terms of their environmental impacts, the determination of impact significance for each of them and the depiction of ways to avoid, minimize, mitigate or compensate remaining impacts and the formulation of recommendations13. Greening within SEA may be addressed through different methodological approaches. Different environmental components (eg air, water, flora, fauna) are often assessed in different ways, based on, eg quantitative and qualitative methods and techniques14. SEA offers a process that enables ‘green’ aspects to be considered more systematically in developing policies, plans, programmes and mega projects (PPPP) – through providing for a systematic and participatory decision-support process that can either accompany or structure the underlying PPPP. n Greening outcomes through SEA. SEA is needed as PPPPs often tend to give insufficient consideration to ‘green’ aspects. It aims to lead to changes to or in a PPPP or even a related PPPP. Changes can be either direct (eg in the design of the PPPP or environmental management commitments/conditions) or indirect – in the medium to long term (eg leading to changed attitudes or values of those involved in the process, or changes in established routines of institutions). But there is no prescriptive, ‘one size fits all’ approach to SEA. It needs to be adapted and tailor- made to the context in which it is applied. But at the plan and programme level, good practice SEA usually involves the four stages shown in Figure 1, adapted from the characteristics of environmental impact assessment (EIA). In policy-making, usually this will not be possible, because of the complex, non-linear character of this process. Effective SEA, particularly at the policy level, also depends on an adaptive and continuous process focused on strengthening institutions and governance rather than just a simple, linear, technical approach, as is often found in EIA (Figure 2). This is a significant challenge. A recent evaluation of six World Bank SEA pilots which focused on an institutions-centred approach drew a number of key lessons (World Bank 2011): n SEA can, under conducive conditions, contribute to improved formulation and implementation of sector reform; n Ownership, capacity and trust are necessary conditions for effective environmental mainstreaming at the policy level, and long-term constituency building is needed. These requirements mean that the potential benefits of policy SEA must be clearly articulated; n Contextual factor\n",

As a starting point, it is important to note that the conflict in Kosovo has primarily been analysed in relation to violence between its two main ethnic groups or the ethics and legality of the NATO intervention there in 1999. Unlike other civil wars, the economic dynamics of this conflict have received much less attention in terms of academic investigations into the political-economy of conflict. However, the same economic processes and relationships which in both academic and policy circles are cited as impacting more ‘infamous’ war economies, such as those in Sierra Leone and Afghanistan, have been well documented by aid practitioners and policy makers as having impacted upon the conflict and post-conflict dynamic in Kosovo. Although less visible in terms of media coverage and popular conceptions of the causes and key characteristics of the political violence there, economic motivations, the trade of goods and services to fund the war and the ongoing impact of such economic issues in the post-conflict phase are indeed defining features of all of the Balkan conflicts which took place throughout the 1990s (Andreas, 2004; Gouvnev, 2003; Hislope, 2002; Korovilas, 2002; Pugh and Cooper, 2004). In these conflicts, rebel factions engaged in illicit cross-border trade in order to buy arms and continue their struggle, large profits were made by conflict entrepreneurs, remittances from the Diaspora were a defining feature and source of funding, the political and economic benefits of peace have been divided amongst former belligerents and there has been a continuance of these activities and relationships into the post-conflict phase. Of course, each war economy and the factors contributing to it need to be 69', '4062 building a peace economy_2652Prelims 25/11/2013 15:06 Page 70 Building a peace economy? contextualised. The particular political, social and economic dynamics influ- encing the nature and impact of each war economy needs to be considered not only in analytical terms but also in terms of creating policies to transform it. Following a review of the war economy in Kosovo, analysis in Chapters 5 to 7 will draw on the processes of intervention and post-conflict programming related to attempts to transform it. While a unique case in some regards, the examination of practices of aid and intervention in the area does have a wider applicability. Kosovo provides an excellent opportunity to study the transfor- mation agenda in a broad and general sense as it has undergone rapid and extreme forms of intervention, with the DSI engaging in extensive program- ming in several relevant transformation policies. These reforms have been implemented with great speed and by a wide range of actors, allowing for comparative work that results in a more comprehensive analysis of transfor- mation attempts. Further, Kosovo is an informative case due to the longevity of intervention by the DSI. Whilst this study does not cover the entirety of the intervention (focusing primarily on the era before Kosovo declared independ- ence), it does explore processes of intervention that cover nearly a decade of reform. Further, aid praxis in Kosovo, whilst itself influenced by liberal peace blueprints, has also doubled as a laboratory for creating new techniques and reworking reform processes that have in turn influenced subsequent inter- ventions, making it an essential case study for understanding ongoing and future transformation projects. Finally, it is important to note that it is not the concrete outcomes of the reforms in Kosovo (which are indeed context-specific moving targets) which offer the most useful lessons regarding transformation programming, but rather the general processes of reform observed in a range of interventions. What is under scrutiny, and where the most utility in terms of understanding DSI interventions can be found, are the day-to-day mechanics of peacebuild- ing and statebuilding. Therefore, this work is not concerned with assessing the final effects of intervention (if that is even possible), but rather with the motivations and rationale that underpin policy decisions which affect the course of post-conflict economies. The relevant lessons come from under- standing the varied trajectories of reform as opposed to any clear end state. In other words, the real value of exploring the case of Kosovo over several years of intervention, is that it provides an assessment of policy implementation as it was occurring, and not simply a post-facto assessment. An important finding that emerges from studying these active moments of reform is the heterogeneity of responses. Whilst faced with underlying principles, blue- prints and a comparable set of circumstances, forthcoming analysis reveals that actors within the DSI do adopt a range of strategies when faced with similar situations – some of these fitting with the liberal peace discourse and others appearing to deviate from the expected template. The revelations of 70', '4062 building a peace economy_2652Prelims 25/11/2013 15:06 Page 71 Transforming a war economy: Kosovo conformity, diversity and even subversion discovered through an assessment of transformation policies in Kosovo will offer much in terms of understanding both the hurdles to and opportunities for effective transformation elsewhere. The political economy of violence in Kosovo: evidence and intervention The history of political violence in Kosovo has been well studied and scruti- nised (Cviic, 2005; Djilas, 1998; Vickers, 1994, 1998). However, several notable events are relevant for understanding the outbreak of war in the territory in the 1990s, and the NATO intervention that followed. To begin, a series of decisions made by the Serbian parliament throughout the 1980s which sought to increase Serbian state control over Kosovo are often cited as key triggers to the outbreak of violence in the following decade. These decisions culminated in the territory’s autonomous status being formally revoked in 1990. Such a shift was a major disruption to the status quo in Kosovo, which while formally part of Serbia had previously enjoyed a great deal of independence from the state. In 1963 it had been granted provincial status, similar to the province of Vojvodina in the north of Serbia, and by the 1970s enjoyed a status almost on a par with the other republics of Yugoslavia (Djilas, 1998). The 1969 Serbian parliament made constitutional changes granting Kosovo its own Supreme Court and policy-making powers as well as language and minority rights. The revocation of autonomous status was accompanied by the firing, en masse, of Albanians from civil service positions. In response, the Albanian community, which made up roughly 88 per cent of the population (Vickers, 1994: 40) organised a referendum in 1991, resulting in Kosovo declaring itself an independent and sovereign republic. Ibrahim Rugova of the Albanian Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) was elected president. This referendum was not recognised by the Serbs, the Serbian state or other external actors. Under Rugova, Kosovo embarked on a non-violent campaign of peaceful resistance to Serb rule. A parallel financial system which collected a 3 per cent tax from Albanians abroad and within the country was used to fund a shadow administration which included the provision of health- care and education. This tax was collected mostly through voluntary contributions, although there is some evidence of coercion. The territory operated in this way, with relatively low levels of physical violence, for the first half of the 1990s, although Serbian reprisals and arrests of Albanian political leaders were growing, along with increased violence against civilians. Nonetheless, Rugova’s non-violence agenda prevailed until the middle of the decade at which point divisions within Kosovo Albanian society emerged and the peaceful facade rapidly disintegrated. Explanations regarding the causes of this disintegration are varied. One explanation surrounds the failure of the international community to address problems in 71', '4062 building a peace economy_2652Prelims 25/11/2013 15:06 Page 72 Building a peace economy? Kosovo during the Dayton accords which resolved the conflicts in Croatia and Bosnia (O’Neill, 2002). The failure to reward Kosovars for the non-violent approach, and the decision not to push for agreements on Kosovo with the Serb regime, led some in the territory to question the policy of non-violent resistance, strengthening more radical elements within the area, including elements committed to using violence to achieve political ends (Yannis, 2003). Further, the failure of Dayton to deal with the problem of Kosovo possibly emboldened Milosevic to pursue a policy of ethnic cleansing and repression in Kosovo (Hirsch, 1999). The disintegration of Yugoslavia led to the Serbian government tighten- ing its grip on what territory and resources it could control – this included Kosovo. In addition, the wars in the other parts of the former Yugoslavia led to increased immigration of Serbs to Kosovo which altered the demographic balance and increased social tensions (O’Neill, 2002). Changes in the political situation in the state of Albania also changed the political dynamic of Kosovo, modifying the opportunity structure in favour of those committed to using violence to achieve independence. In 1997 the Albanian state collapsed, and as Judah notes, ‘in the ensuing chaos the government lost control, the army dissolved, the police ran away and arms d\n",

Wilson, Lieutenant General, and act as guarantors and funders of any agreements that result from it. U.S. Marine Corps; President, National Defense University introduction On January 13, 2006, the sleepy village of Damadola in the Bajaur tribal district of Pakistan on the Afghan frontier became the focus of global attention. With the American news networks in the lead, global media broadcast coverage of the Central Intelligence Agency’s attempt to kill al Qaeda’s number two, Ayman al-Zawahiri, who had reportedly attended a dinner in the village to commemorate the Muslim holiday `Id-ul-Adha. Pictures of tribal members digging dead bodies from the debris of their bombed-out mud houses were beamed around the globe. Pakistan’s Islamist political parties called for severing all ties with the United States for this attack on the country ’s sovereignty (Reuters 2006). President Pervez Musharraf, who initially minimized the attack ’s importance, later announced that at least five top al Qaeda figures had been killed, although al-Zawahiri himself had escaped (Khan 2006). Three days later, in what appeared to be a reprisal, a suicide bomber riding a motorcycle blew himself up among spectators of a wrestling match in the southern Afghan town of Spin Boldak, across from the Pakistani border town of Chaman. It was Afghanistan’s worst suicide attack, killing twenty-two civilians and leaving dozens more injured (Synovitz 2006). This was the largest in a rash of suicide attacks in Afghanistan, some of which have taken place even in the relatively secure northern and western provinces (Qureshi and 2', 'Sarwaryar 2006). With 1,500 violent deaths, more members of the Afghan security forces More members of the Afghan and the U.S.-led international coalition were killed in combat in 2005 than in any year since the overthrow of the Taliban regime in late 2001. In the first six months of 2006, security forces and the U.S.-led Afghanistan faced thirty-two suicide attacks, unprecedented in the country ’s three international coalition were killed decades of violence (Karzai and Jones 2006).

            "['Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Yemen: The Long-Term Civil Challenges and Host Country Threats from “Failed State” Wars Anthony H. Cordesman With the assistance of Max Molot Working Draft: Updated October 25, 2019 Please provide comments to acordesman@gmail.com Photo: AHMAD AL-RUBAYE/AFP/Getty Images', 'Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Yemen: The Long-Term Civil Challenges and Host Country Threats from “Failed State” Wars Anthony H. Cordesman This analysis explores several key aspects of the longer-term civil challenges that have curbed U.S. success in its “long wars” in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria — as well as its more limited involvements in Libya and Yemen. It focuses on the fact that all five states have deep structural problems that make them “failed states” in many similar areas of governance, major social changes, and development. It shows that these failures are so serious that they make the “host country” or national government a key cause of civil unrest and conflict and – in many ways – as much of a threat as the extremist and terrorist movements the U.S. is seeking to defeat. Looking Beyond Symptoms Like Extremism and Terrorism to Host Countries and Regimes as the Cause of Civil Violence The analysis warns that these structural problems are likely to shape many new civil conflicts and outbreaks of extremism, terrorism, and civil conflict in the MENA region, South Asia, and Central Asia. It also warns that they will be powerful, enduring destabilizing forces regardless of how successful the U.S., its partners, and the host country are in terms of defeating terrorist movements and insurgencies. Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya and Yemen — and many of their neighbors — not only have extremely poor governance, and high levels of corruption, they are under intense pressure from increases in population, urbanization, and social change that go far beyond their current problems with any given groups of extremists. These problems are so serious that they are likely to lead to further extremism, and civil conflict for at least the next decade. They also are so serious that no attempt at dealing with major threats from extremism, terrorism, or insurgency can be successful that only focuses on the security and military dimensions of such threats. The same is true of any efforts that focus on peace negotiations and short-term recovery aid. “Nation-building” does impose massive challenges of its own, but ignoring the forces that create “failed states” will both make any truly successful effort at conflict resolution impossible, but almost ensure the rise or resurgence of terrorism and civil conflict. This analysis does not attempt to simplify the range of factors involved or to find a single set of main causes of extremism, terrorism, and insurgency. It does not attempt to offer simply or optimistic answers to problems that need far more in-depth analysis, and where it may be impossible to find truly workable solutions until a given state is finally driven to the point where it is ready to help itself. In the real world, the only practical choice may be to contain the threats in given country to its own territory – a form of strategic triage that must give priority to countries that are actually willing to address their civil challenges and have the unity to act. The goal of this analysis is to demonstrate the full level of complexity involved, and to suggest that that any successful effort must look beyond defeating current enemies, look beyond current military and security trends, and look beyond the more immediate and topical civil causes of extremism like leadership, politics, and extremist ideologies.', 'The Key Long-Term Forces that Create “Failed States” This report focuses on exploring the deep structural reasons these five nations have become “failed states,” and comparing the civil trends involved. Its Table of Contents is shown below, and it shows that the study focuses on the civil side of civil-military relations. It attempts to find quantitative metrics that illustrate the importance of each key factor, and it examines key longer- term trends in the following forces that will make Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Yemen enduring problems: • The enduring civil costs of terrorism, insurgency and civil war, and their post conflict impact. • The impact of key problems in governance that are often largely independent of a particular leader and the country’s political system – whether democratic or authoritarian. • The permeating impact of corruption, which along with security and secure employment/income poll as the three key sources of resentment, anger, and loss of confidence in the regime. • The radical ongoing shifts growing out of demographics, population pressure, a major youth bulge, and shifts in the economy and social structure from agriculture and to service, government jobs, industry, and urbanization. Military Operations and Tactical Victories Cannot “Win” America’s Current Wars The analysis indicates that these civil forces are so important that the ability to help a given country deal with these longer-term challenges in civil-military affairs will be as important in achieving any kind of lasting victory and ongoing stability as the goal of military success and dealing with shorter term civil issues like politics and leadership. It also shows why U.S. military efforts in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan, Libya, and Yemen that focus too narrowly on security, counterterrorism, and counterinsurgency will not lead to real victories in terms of conflict resolution or to lasting favorable outcomes and national stability. The United States cannot win in any of these countries by fighting half a war – focusing on the direct enemy rather than the flaws in the host county it is trying to aid, and by prioritizing the security sector at the expense of the civil one. More broadly, the forces that helped turn Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Yemen into “failed states” that do not meet the basic needs of their peoples are common to far too many other states in the developing world. While this study does not examine such cases, it is also clear that similar forces have helped shape violence and extremism in a wide range of African states, in Pakistan and several Central Asian states, in countries as diverse as Nepal and Cambodia, and in nations like Columbia and most Central American states. The “failed state” or “failing state” problem is not the function of a given culture or religion. It is a function of broader forces that affect all too many countries throughout the developing world. If the U.S. is to limit the growth of extremism and terrorism within new civil wars and insurgencies, and promote stability in key states, it must look at Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Yemen as case studies in the causes of instability and such threats to American interests and the American Homeland. It must work with other states to address such civil challenges, both to limit the rise of new threats and limit its involvement in future wars.', 'Table of Contents LOOKING BEYOND SYMPTOMS LIKE EXTREMISM AND TERRORISM TO HOST COUNTRIES AND REGIMES AS THE CAUSE OF CIVIL VIOLENCE .................................................................................................................................................................................. 2 THE KEY LONG-TERM FORCES THAT CREATE “FAILED STATES” ................................................................................................ 3 Military Operations and Tactical Victories Cannot “Win” America’s Current Wars ............................................. 3 THE ENDURING CIVIL COSTS OF TERRORISM AND WAR ......................................................................................... 6 TRACING THE PATTERNS IN VIOLENCE ................................................................................................................................ 7 Figure One: Arab Role in Global Terrorism and Violence ..................................................................................... 8 Figure Two: The Broader Patterns of Violence within the Arab World Through 2017 ......................................... 9 THE COSTS IN KILLED AND WOUNDED .............................................................................................................................. 10 THE COSTS TO THE LIVING AND SURVIVORS ....................................................................................................................... 11 Figure Three: Estimated Impact of Continued Conflicts on Total Population of Arab Countries: 1990-2030 .... 13 Figure Four: The Impact of the “Arab Winter” on Increases in Refugees and Forced Displacements: 2010-2017 ........................................................................................................................................................................... 14 Figure Five: World Bank Estimate of Internally Displaced Persons, Total Displaced by Conflict and Violence: 2009-2018 .......................................................................................................................................................... 15 Figure Six: Syria as a Case Study: UN Estimate of Human Cost of War as of December 2018 ........................... 16 Figure Seven: Impact of Violence and Instability on Percent of Working Poor: 2000-2017 ............................... 17 THE UNKNOWN HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC COSTS OF WAR AND TRANSITION TO NEW PATHS OF DEVELOPMENT ........ 18 Figure Eight: Comparative Human Development Estimates in Countries with Failed State Wars ..................... 19 Figure Nine: Regression in Human Development Indicators Since the “Arab Winter” Began in 2011 ............... 20 Figure Ten: The Economic Cost of Extremism Before the Most Serious Impacts of the Fighting Iraq and Syria 21 LOOKING AT PERCEPTIONS OF CAUSES ....................................\n",

            "['CHAPTER TWO Rental Housing and the Role of Preservation In this chapter, we provide the context for the Window of Opportunity initiative by describing the nature and extent of the affordable rental housing problem at the time that WOO began. To do so, we first provide an overview of rental housing generally and then document changes in the availability of affordable rental housing over the 1990s, the decade leading up to WOO. Since the aim of Window of Opportunity is the preservation of privately owned affordable rental housing, in this chapter we also provide an overview of rental housing preservation, explain what preservation is, how it works, and types of preservation activity from the 1980s to 2015. Even though Window of Opportunity focused largely (but not exclusively) on the pres- ervation of multifamily rental housing (defined as five or more rental units per property), we include in our analyses both single-family and multifamily rentals, since the main purpose of this analysis is to provide a complete picture of rental affordability. An Overview of Rental Housing in the Decade Leading Up to Window of Opportunity: 1990–2000 Understanding the extent of the affordable rental housing problem in 2000, when WOO began, requires knowledge of rental housing markets and the dynamics of demand and supply that governed them between 1990 and 2000. In this section, we first briefly describe the rental market in the United States in that period, then identify the factors that drove changes in the demand for and supply of rental housing from 1990 to 2000. These changes were instrumental for changes in the affordability of rental housing during the decade. As part of this discussion, we look at trends in the stock of federally assisted rental housing. U.S. Rental Housing Markets: Overview and 1990 Baseline Over the past 50 years, approximately two-thirds of U.S. households in any given year have been homeowners, leaving one-third of U.S. households as renters. More specifically, the rate held steady near 64 percent between 1970 and 1993, before rising sharply to 69 percent between 1993 and 2004. Since then, the rate has fallen back to under 64 percent, owing in large part to mortgage foreclosures. This last development increased demand for rental housing, as we discuss later in the report. Not surprisingly, we observe the same two-thirds ownership to one-third rentals ratio in the overall housing stock. According to the Census, of the 92 million housing units that were occupied in 1990, approximately 33 million of those were occupied by renter households. 7', '8 Preservation of Affordable Rental Housing: The Window of Opportunity Initiative As we will discuss, this ratio of two-thirds owner to one-third renter partly reflects the demographics of the United States—since income, which is correlated with age and educa- tion, is a driver of homeownership—but the ratio also reflects policy choices, such as mortgage market deregulation, tax policy, and availability of credit (Andrews and Sanchez, 2011). For example, total tax expenditures for owner-occupied housing for 2016 are projected in the Presi- dent’s Budget to total $234 billion, not including the interest rate subsidy homeowners receive via Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (White House Office of Management and Budget, 2016, Table 14-1). By comparison, total federal rental assistance and the LIHTC program combine to about $47 billion. So while approximately two-thirds of American households are homeown- ers, more than 80 percent of federal housing subsidies go to them. The set of U.S. federal housing policies to promote rental housing has been and remains far less than the large federal apparatus to support homeowners. Policies and programs that promote homeownership include the mortgage interest deduction on federal income taxes, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs federal mortgage guarantees, and the government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Bank system. While many of these same entities also insure or finance rental housing, they do so on a smaller scale relative to homeownership. While the White House has held conferences on homeownership as early as 1931, the first-ever White House conference focused on rental housing occurred in 2010 at HUD. The disparity in policy apparatus has had the effect of favoring and expanding homeownership. Who Rents A basic review of Census data indicates that there are a number of notable differences between renter households and homeowners; these differences have existed for decades. First, renters are more likely to be unmarried than homeowners. In 1990, for example, the renter rate among married couples was 22 percent, while among singles it was 53 percent.1 The discrepancy is partly because married couples tend to have higher household incomes than singles, which enables them to more easily become homeowners. Married couples also tend to be less mobile, which means they can amortize the fixed costs of owning over a longer period of time better than singles. For a variety of reasons, including discrimination, more limited access to credit, and lower average incomes, nonwhites were and continue to be more likely to be renters than whites. In 1990, the gap between nonwhites and whites in rates of renting was 24 percentage points: 31 percent of white households rented compared with 54 percent of nonwhite house- holds.2 Because higher incomes are generally needed to become homeowners, renters also tend to be less educated and younger than homeowners. In 1990, the median age and income of renters were 36 and $20,000, respectively; for owners, they were 51 and $36,000. We will see below that changes in these factors played a key role in the changes in demand for rental hous- ing that were observed during the 1990s. Rental Affordability In considering the price and affordability of rental housing, one approach researchers com- monly use is to choose a benchmark income level and define as affordable any unit with a rent 1 These data come from Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) tabulations (Ruggles et al., 2015). 2 These data come from IPUMS tabulations (Ruggles et al., 2015).', 'Rental Housing and the Role of Preservation 9 less than 30 percent of that income.3 Given that renters generally have lower incomes than homeowners, we select a relatively low income of 50 percent of the area median income as a benchmark. By this metric, Census data indicate that 68 percent of the 34 million rental units (which is a little over 23 million homes) occupied in 1990 were affordable. These 23 million affordable rental homes fall into one of two categories: 1. unsubsidized, meaning that the market-rate rents for those homes are “naturally” afford- able to low-income households 2. subsidized from federal, state, and local public sources (or some combination of the three) to make rent levels affordable to low-income households. The large majority (approximately 84 percent) of these 23 million rental homes belong to the first category.4 Note that Window of Opportunity focused almost exclusively on the pres- ervation of privately owned unsubsidized and subsidized affordable rental homes within mul- tifamily properties with five or more units. With a few exceptions, Window of Opportunity excluded the preservation of single-family affordable rental homes (defined as properties with one to four units), and it excluded the preservation of the 1.4 million public housing rental homes. This is a significant exclusion, since a little over one half of affordable rental housing in the United States is in single-family properties. For most of this report, we take an alternative approach from prior research to describe rental market affordability conditions. Instead of selecting an income threshold and defin- ing all units with rents less than 30 percent of that threshold as being affordable, we conduct a matching exercise that we developed. We include the description of this matching exercise here rather than an appendix to allow the reader to understand the results of our analysis. We do this to resolve a criticism of prior analyses that measure affordability of rent as the share of income a low-income household spends on rent. As critics have pointed out (e.g., Schwartz and Wilson, 2008), the share of income approach is problematic because spending more than 30 percent of income on housing may reflect some households’ preferences rather than indi- cate a policy problem. Our methodology resolves that problem by determining the fraction of metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the United States where households would have no choice but to spend a large fraction of income on housing, to establish the widespread lack of affordability. In our matching exercise, we first follow standard practice and define a rent as “afford- able” if it equals 30 percent or less of a household’s income. But we then deviate from common practice by examining what share of income a renter at the 20th percentile of the income dis- tribution would have to pay if that household were hypothetically “matched” to a rental home that itself had a rent level at the 20th percentile of the rent distribution within their MSA. We repeat that same matching of income percentile to rent percentile for the 40th, 60th, and 80th percentiles.5 3 The 30 percent threshold is a common threshold for the appropriate share of income a household should devote to housing and is applied in many policy contexts. See, for example, HUD’s Housing Choice Voucher program. 4 This count excludes local- and state-subsidized properties (if they are not also federally subsidized) as there is incomplete data to count all forms of local, state, and federal subsidized housing. However, federal subsidy is by far the largest source. 5 Appendix A describes our methods in greater detail as well as our data sources.', '10 Preservation of \n",

            "['Report - June 2020 Under Threat & Left Out: NYC’s Immigrants and the Coronavirus Crisis Immigrant New Yorkers are enduring unprecedented economic pain from the pandemic—and yet they have been almost completely shut out of government programs created for those in need, CUF research and interviews with two dozen nonprofit leaders reveals. by Sarah Amandolare, Laird Gallagher, Jonathan Bowles, and Eli Dvorkin Immigrants have been essential to New York City’s economic resurgence over the past four decades. They accounted for percent the city’s population growth between 1980 and 2018, founded more than half of all small businesses in the city1, 107 and helped spark dramatic turnarounds in numerous neighborhoods that had emptied out in the 1970s. More recently, immigrant New Yorkers have played an indispensable role on the front lines of the COVID-19 crisis, comprising more than half of the city’s essential workers. Now New York’s immigrants are the ones in need of help—but the government response so far has largely left them behind. Interviews with nearly two dozen leaders of nonprofits that work closely with immigrants across the five boroughs reveal that immigrant New Yorkers are confronting unprecedented economic pain from the pandemic—and yet they have been almost completely shut out of government stimulus programs created for those in need. Nine of the organizations we spoke with say that at least 75 percent of their immigrant clients have lost jobs because of the pandemic. For instance, 90 percent of immigrants served by the Harlem-based African Services Committee have lost their primary source of income, while 95 percent of the day laborers and fully 100 percent of the domestic workers and nail salon workers supported by Staten Island–based La Colmena are now out of work.', \"This devastating loss of income has led to widespread food insecurity among immigrant populations across the five boroughs. Multiple organizations report that as much as 75 percent of their clients are going hungry. For example, 65 percent of African Service Committee clients have experienced food insecurity, while 40 percent of Ridgewood-based POMOC’s Polish-speaking clients say they do not have enough food for themselves or their children. “Virtually the entire population we serve is jobless and facing food insecurity,” says Annetta Seecharran, executive director of Queens-based Chhaya CDC, which provides services for South Asian and Indo-Caribbean communities. Yet despite the mass scale unemployment hitting the city’s immigrants, they have been almost entirely shut out of federal cash relief. Several of the nonprofit organizations we interviewed for this report told us that 95 to 100 percent of their immigrant clients have not received or are ineligible for the IRS stimulus check. “So far, of the 108 clients my team has spoken to over the past four weeks, 0 percent have received or expect to receive the $1,200 cash assistance,” says Ravi Ragbir, executive director of New Sanctuary Coalition. Gonzalo Mercado, a board member of La Colmena and New York coordinator of the National Day Labor Organizing Network, adds, “About 99.9 percent of the community La Colmena works with is not eligible for the federal stimulus check, even though they have American-born children.” Current city and state relief efforts directed at New York’s immigrants, while well-intentioned, are dwarfed by the monumental needs of the estimated 192,000 undocumented workers in New York City who have lost their jobs—an alarming figure that our research suggests may be just a fraction of the total.2 In the meantime, nearly every organization we reached is trying to distribute food and financial relief to immigrant clients or connect clients to food pantries. “On food distribution days, about 300 or 400 people come. In an hour, the food's gone,” says Yesenia Mata, executive director of La Colmena. Among our key findings on the sheer extent of income loss: “All” of the 1,500 to 2,000 Nepali-speaking nail salon workers served by Adhikaar have lost their jobs “without any certainty whether they would get their jobs back.” 80 percent of the businesses working with the Business Center for New Americans have closed due to the pandemic. (It remain unclear whether some of these businesses will be able to come back during subsequent phases of reopening.) 90 percent of the people served by South Bronx–based Masa have lost their primary source of income and are experiencing food insecurity. 90 percent of community members served by an organization supporting Brooklyn’s Arab community no longer have jobs. 76 percent of Chinese Progressive Association clients—including those who work in restaurants, and nail and beauty salons—are not working at all. 75 percent out of the 450 clients of Mercy Center’s Immigrant Services program in the Bronx have lost their primary source of income. In one Chinese American Planning Council preschool class of 24 children, “20 out of 24 families lost their jobs in March.” Job loss, business closures, and food insecurity are bearing down on immigrant communities, creating untenable pressure inside households that are often crowded with more than one family and facing pressures to keep up with rent payments, utility bills, and basic needs. At the same time, parents who lack English language skills and the technology needed for remote learning are struggling to find the time and space to help their children complete assignments. And many immigrant students are tasked with caring for younger siblings or relatives while their parents go to work on the front lines of the Center for an Urban Future\", 'pandemic. It comes as little surprise that many organizations we interviewed expressed concern for their clients’ mental health. Though some organizations offer counseling and other services, waitlists are building up quickly and both providers and clients have struggled to transition to telehealth-only models—especially for clients with limited or no access to broadband and devices. Preventive health services have become even more difficult for immigrants to access, leaving their communities in a cycle of vulnerability to COVID-19. The eviction moratorium is scheduled to end in August, and financially strapped tenants will be expected to pay back-rent. And as the city reopens, organizations fear exhausted frontline immigrant workers will be at greatest risk amid a second wave of infections, and anti-Asian discrimination could spike again. This report —a partnership between the Center for an Urban Future and New York Immigration Coalition—documents the financial and material hardship, barriers to relief, and new challenges facing New York’s immigrant communities. The report, which is based on interviews with leaders of more than twenty immigrant-serving organizations across the five boroughs, also provides specific recommendations as to what city and state policymakers should do right now. The vast majority of immigrants served by the community-based organizations we spoke to have lost their primary source of income and are seeking food aid and financial relief. 95 percent of NMIC clients (78 of 82 people) experiencing food insecurity due to COVID-19 are immigrants. (NMIC provides legal, social, and education/career services in northern Manhattan and the Bronx.) “Of the undocumented groups, 100 percent are really struggling with having lost their primary source of income. They are experiencing food insecurity,” says a source at a labor organization representing retail workers. 60 to 70 percent of the clients of POMOC, an organization that works with the Polish community in Ridgewood, have lost their primary source of income. 65 percent of Libertas Center for Human Rights clients have lost their primary source of income, and 25 percent are experiencing food insecurity. “[Food] is difficult to find despite the city and state providing resources. Some of our clients have been deemed ineligible for services without rationale and many are afraid to leave their apartments to pick up food and cannot afford delivery,” the organization reports. 60 to 70 percent of the 400 domestic workers recently contacted by Adhikaar are not being paid and are unsure if or when they will be called back to work. 20 to 25 percent have continued to work, often moving in with employees with little to no time off. The remaining 5 to 10 percent were laid off within two weeks of the start of the pandemic. “48 percent of the immigrant clients I was directly in touch with in April requested help with one or more household bills they were unable to pay,” says one African Services Committee staff member. “Over 50 percent if not closer to 75 percent (if not higher)” of Catholic Charities of New York’s immigrant clients have lost their primary source of income. Most of the organization’s South Bronx clients are domestic, construction, or restaurant workers, Uber/Lyft drivers, or vendors. “The remaining percentage either has never had a primary source of income or are essential workers,” the organization reports. Approximately 50 to 75 percent are experiencing food insecurity. “50 percent of community members have reported that they have lost their income or jobs,” according to the Chinese American Planning Council. “In one preschool class of 24 children, 20 out of 24 families lost their jobs in March,” the organization says. In addition, youth who are helping care for younger siblings while their parents go to work “are experiencing anxiety about food as they do not know how to cook and may not have enough to eat at home. Some youth have even resorted to rationing their daily food intake to ensure their food does not run out.” 80 percent of the clients of the Business Center for New Americans have closed their businesses. “About 40 percent were, within 2 to 3 weeks of no income, experiencing food insecurity.

            "['t w o Global Networks and the Materiality of Immaterial Labor This chapter focuses on one of the central issues in contemporary debates over the status of labor in the digital economy: the issue of immaterial labor. Writers such as Antonio Negri and Manuel Castells—who provide the basic framework of assumptions for all contemporary theories of immaterial labor—propose that digital technologies change the way in which value is produced and, as a result, that the economy is shifting away from the pro- duction of material commodities and toward immaterial commodities in- cluding information and affect, as well as the terms of life itself. In effect, they represent digital technologies as shifting the economic terrain of the global economy away from issues of class and exploitation and toward a new form of capitalism based upon immaterial labor. In contrast, I offer an extended analysis of the contemporary global economy and explain why we are actually witnessing the heightening of the economic contradictions between labor and capital rather than their resolution. 50 ................. 18088$ $CH2 08-04-11 13:44:01 PS PAGE 50', 'Global Networks and the Materiality of Immaterial Labor 51 The Class Contradictions of Digital Globalization Concepts are abstractions of the actual conditions of life and, for this rea- son, historical maps of the social conflicts that determine which theories are taken as accurate representations of reality and which are marginalized or excluded as ‘‘terrorist’’ threats to the existing order1 In other words, al- though concepts reflect the material developments of labor and therefore must be understood in relation to what is, they are never simply neutral reports of the existing but instead represent a divided space in which com- peting classes ‘‘become conscious of the conflict’’ over the existing and ‘‘fight it out.’’2 It is in this context that since its first emergence in the 1980s, globalization has become one of the primary—and at the same time highly contested—concepts in cultural and social theory for describing the emer- gence of a regime of capital accumulation that developed in the years fol- lowing World War II, covering the period from what is known as the long boom, through the period of global economic recession described as the long downturn, and up to the contemporary moment.3 In mainstream and popular presses, globalization is championed as the period of capitalism’s ultimate triumph over communism with the end of the Cold War and, furthermore, the transcendence of its own internal con- tradiction between capital and labor in the apparent centrality of cultural production and immaterial labor to the digital ‘‘revolution’’ of society. For example, according to Yochai Benkler in The Wealth of Networks, the emerg- ing digital technologies are bringing with them a ‘‘new mode of produc- tion’’4 that ‘‘allows people to reach across space and political divisions.’’5 Similarly, Clay Shirky proposes in Here Comes Everybody that ‘‘for the last hundred years the big organizational question has been whether any given task was taken on by the state, directing the effort in a planned way [social- ism], or by businesses competing in a market [capitalism].’’6 However, with the advent of digital technologies, he writes, there is now a ‘‘third alterna- tive’’—namely, ‘‘action by loosely structured groups, operating without managerial direction and outside the profit motive.’’7 While this representa- tion of a world remade in the image of digital technologies has become, in the words of Chris Harman, a ‘‘new orthodoxy’’ that is ‘‘used to mean that the world economy has reached a new stage, which governments and work- ers alike are virtually powerless to withstand,’’8 the reality is that what is ................. 18088$ $CH2 08-04-11 13:44:01 PS PAGE 51', '52 Global Networks and the Materiality of Immaterial Labor presented in contemporary theory as a seamless transition to a new digital and global world functions ideologically to banish any discussion of the exploitation of labor that is at the core of capitalist production by substitut- ing changes in how something is produced or where production takes place for a transformation in the fundamental logic that governs production under capitalism. In order to understand the centrality of exploitation to the global expan- sion of capitalism it is important to examine the way in which the digital reading of globalization is based upon the presupposition that ‘‘more or less everyone has learned to accept, if not necessarily love, capitalism—in much the same way as they have democracy’’ and ‘‘at this time, no one can see any effective alternatives to the combination of a market economy and a democratic political system.’’9 This conclusion is generally dependent upon two interrelated arguments. First, it is argued that globalization corre- sponds to a ‘‘broad cultural shift . . . away from a dominance of production over our everyday lives to a dominance of consumption,’’10 in the sense that the primary source for the accumulation of new value is said to no longer be labor or manufacture (material commodity production), but knowledge and its embodiment in communications and other digital technologies. Ac- cording to sociologist Helmut Willke, the shift to a digital economy means that ‘‘digital goods are weightless and they move along the fiber optic lines at the speed of light’’ and thus operate beyond the former political and economic controls of industrial, national capitalism.11 It is on these terms that the so-called digital globalization is understood to constitute a new stage of capitalism based upon the seemingly inexhaustible resource of in- formation, which, it is assumed, disrupts the economics of scarcity that is manifest in the class inequalities of capitalism and removes the divisions of ownership that constituted class identities in the predigital age by placing the means of production in the hands of every creative person. As Mark Poster argues, ‘‘there is no need for a capitalist market in the area of digital cultural objects, and these objects need not become commodities . . . indeed, digital cultural objects resist market mechanisms’’ and, in turn, transform ‘‘the nature of the producer and the consumer, blurring the boundary be- tween them.’’12 Accordingly, the global expansion of a new regime of capital accumulation based upon knowledge has the effect of creating spaces of cultural heterogeneity and exchange in which the ‘‘fixities of nation, com- munity, ethnicity and class,’’ as Jan Nederveen Pieterse states, ‘‘become ................. 18088$ $CH2 08-04-11 13:44:01 PS PAGE 52', 'Global Networks and the Materiality of Immaterial Labor 53 fragments’’ dispersed in the flows of financial markets and cultural ex- changes.13 Or, as Ulrich Beck concisely puts it, ‘‘the notion of a class society remains useful only as an image of the past.’’14 The elevation of digital over analogue production is therefore represented as ushering in a more ‘‘demo- cratic’’ globalization because of the ways in which it supposedly re-maps cultural and political institutions as spaces defined in the terms of individual desire and personal lifestyles, rather than social need.15 As management the- orists Klaus Go ̈rtz and Nadine Bleher write, ‘‘technological innovations have enabled an increasing number of individuals to choose, create, and cultivate transnational communities according to their personal interests, values, habits, and attitudes.’’16 Second, it is argued that the development of postlabor means of produc- tion creates the conditions for the expansion of capital globally, in turn disrupting the traditional boundaries between nations, thereby creating a ‘‘flat’’ or ‘‘borderless’’ world of free cultural and financial exchange.17 What flat or borderless signifies is an increased capitalization in the post–World War II period of formerly socialist and Third World nations and their in- corporation into the global system of production, either through the shift- ing of manufacture from the global North (the United States, Canada, the European Union, Russia, Japan, Australia, as well as Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan) to the global South (Central and Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Mexico, and South America) through outsourcing or off-shoring or by becoming integral players in a postnational supply chain that has been enabled by advances in communication as well as the opening up of trade and financial barriers to free up the flow of formerly trapped or unproductive capital.18 Proponents of the flat world thesis point to the expansion of international trade which, according to the IMF, ‘‘has grown five times in real terms since 1980, and its share of world GDP has risen from 36 percent to 55 percent over this period.’’19 This ‘‘flattening’’ of the global economy, in which it is said that the expansion of production and trade relations between nations constitute the emergence of a level playing field between formerly unequal or hostile nations, is essentially premised upon a theory of a ‘‘universal evolution in the direction of capitalism’’ in which there is no longer any ‘‘outside’’ to capitalism.20 In this reading, the developed economies of the North have moved beyond the traditional eco- nomic cycle, while transplanting the conditions of new growth and prosper- ity to the underdeveloped nations in the South.

            "['5 Management, culture and control In the 1990s I was a senior executive in the Australian public service. One evening, at a dinner at a departmental ‘retreat’ for senior managers, I sat next to the man who had just been the keynote speaker. He was the human resource manager for a large, new company that was operating at the cutting edge of technology. He did not know me or my job, just that I was a senior executive. My departmental job had involved, among many things, overseeing a survey on collective bargaining (there had just been major policy reforms) sent to over a thousand randomly selected companies. His company was one of the few at the time with a nonunion collective agreement, and the response rate among them was much lower than among other companies. Without prompting, he told me he had received a survey from my department. (‘Oh, really?’) Yes, but he could not allow it to be distributed among the associates—his word for employees. (‘Why was that?’) It contained the word ‘bargaining’, something that implied conflict, and that wasn’t really an idea he wanted his associates exposed to. It was an intriguing conversation from an otherwise tedious evening, one that told me more than so many studies that had been done with management’s permission. Understanding what was behind that helps us understand the managerial forces shaping the direction that future work will take. The previous chapter told us about the types of jobs that have been growing, and declining, in recent times, how technology is affecting many jobs and how many are likely to be partly or fully replaced by automation. But by extrapolating from current information about jobs and technology, we only get part of the picture of the future of work. 113', 'The ReALITIeS AnD FuTuReS oF WoRk We also saw that the future depends on future technologies, about which our current knowledge is largely inadequate, and on future consumption patterns, about which we know very little. It also depends on future management behaviours about whether to invest in certain technologies (and we spoke quite a bit in the previous chapter about the economics of technology, which shape such investments) and how to use the technologies that they possess or purchase. Before we understand about management behaviours in the future, we need to know about the realities of management behaviour now. There are many realities, many different ways in which management behaves. We must understand the importance of the function of control to management, and some of the key developments in the exercise of managerial control. In doing so, we must refer back to the concept of culturism that featured in interpretations of some of the visions of the future discussed in Chapter 3. Different elements of management strategy or style In studying the current realities of work, we need to consider the main ways of managing employees. How this is undertaken is referred to as management style or management strategy. Both terms are used almost interchangeably in the literature. Views on the meaning of strategy range from ‘rational conscious planning’ to what Mintzberg referred to as something best ‘seen as a pattern in a stream of decisions’.1 To Bray and Littler, strategy referred to ‘the modus operandi of managing labour’ and was ‘a useful method of modelling organisational processes irrespective of the coherence, or otherwise, of the managing director’s consciousness’.2 1 Henry Mintzberg, ‘Strategy Formulation as a Historical Process’. International Studies of Management & Organization 7, no. 2 (1977): 28–40. See also Margaret Gardner and Gillian Palmer, Employment Relations: Industrial Relations and Human Resource Management (Melbourne: Macmillan, 1992). 2 Mark Bray and Craig R. Littler, ‘The Labour Process and Industrial Relations: Review of the Literature’. Labour & Industry 1, no. 3 (1988): 551–87. 114', '5 . MAnAgeMenT, cuLTuRe AnD conTRoL So ‘management style’ is probably a more accurate term than ‘management strategy’ as, for many, strategy implies a plan or coherent pattern of action. It is often difficult to discern that there is a clear strategy shaping management behaviour, even in retrospect. Implicit strategy may be inferred from actions rather than explicitly specified in a plan. The term ‘management style’ denotes a pattern or approach to labour management without implying a conscious or unconscious plan. That said, as mentioned, we use the terms interchangeably as we follow the lead of Mintzberg and of Bray and Littler in not requiring explicit coherence in a strategy. It appears that there are three dimensions, which we discuss in turn, into which management style can be categorised: • high trust versus low trust styles; • collective versus individualising styles; • structured versus unstructured styles. Other dimensions, referred to in some of the literature, mostly fit into one of the three above. 1. High-trust and low-trust approaches One of the most common dimensions of management style is the degree of ‘trust’ exhibited by management towards employees. Chris Wright identifies low-trust and high-trust approaches to labour management.3 The coercive, ‘low-trust’ approach is characterised by low worker autonomy, close supervision and strong discipline such that workers are treated as a commodity and are forced to comply with management commands. For example, staff at a Tesco warehouse had to wear digital armband devices that constantly monitored their performance, and some Irish warehouse workers said they got lower scores on a rating system if they keyed in that they went to the toilet or took a break.4 3 Christopher Wright, The Management of Labour: A History of Australian Employers. Australian Studies in Labour Relations 4 (Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1995). 4 Anne-Marie Walsh, ‘Tesco Staff Forced to Wear Arm Monitors That Track Work Rate’. Irish Independent, 11 February 2013, www.independent.ie/irish-news/tesco-staff-forced-to-wear-arm- monitors-that-track-work-rate-29060257.html. 115', 'The ReALITIeS AnD FuTuReS oF WoRk The consensual, ‘high-trust’ approach occurs where there is mutual trust between the parties, and workers are treated by management as a ‘resource’, not a commodity (so, yes, being treated like a ‘resource’ in this context is a relatively good thing). Management aims to develop and nurture employee talent by giving workers autonomy at work to make decisions and fully use their skills and abilities. Christopher Wright examined high- versus low-trust management style in three areas of the employee–employer relationship: 5 • ‘employment relations’—e.g. human resource (HR) arrangements such as recruitment, training, rewards; • ‘work relations’—how management organises the technical and social aspects of work; • ‘industrial relations’—how employers manage organised labour, and deal with unions and with bargaining (though this last one is better located under our second dimension, discussed below). Wright noted that it was difficult to discern a common pattern of Australian employer behaviour. He also found that there was no single management style among Australian employers. Instead, there were inconsistent patterns of management style, not only between firms but even within firms. Wright argued that employers’ approaches to the management of labour have been complex and contradictory at times: ‘Australian employers have adopted elements of both high-trust and low-trust strategies simultaneously within the same organisation, and sometimes in relation to the same groups of employees.’6 At some points in history, employers have tended to favour elements of the high- trust approach, only to abandon them later. Also, for some groups of employees, employers adopt elements of both the high and the low-trust approach to labour management. (More recently, Wright and colleagues have looked at the role of management consultants in spreading key ideas through managerial ranks across businesses—and the gradual demise of this group, as managers themselves internalise many of the ideas and methods propagated by management consultants and take on some of the characteristics of what the researchers call ‘management as consultancy’.)7 5 Wright, Management of Labour, 6. 6 Ibid. 7 Andrew Sturdy, Christopher Wright, and Nick Wylie, Management as Consultancy: Neo-Bureaucracy and the Consultant Manager (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2015). 116', '5 . MAnAgeMenT, cuLTuRe AnD conTRoL The management literature suggests that, to some extent, there may have been a net shift in emphasis from lower trust to higher trust management styles, often associated with the word ‘empowerment’, although there are many counter-examples.8 Other analysts have developed comparable typologies of management strategies or styles. Although these typologies differ in their precise content and definition, they all establish some form of ‘black hat’/‘white hat’ contrast that relates in part at least to high trust and low trust. Andrew Friedman, for example, distinguished between ‘direct control’ (management try to reduce the responsibility of individual workers by close supervision and by setting out in advance and in great detail the specific tasks allocated to each worker) and ‘responsible autonomy’ (managers try to emphasise the positive aspects of labour capacity, namely its malleability, so that workers are granted responsibility and status, supervision is restricted, loyalty is rewarded etc.). The choice taken was seen as depending on the degree of competition in labour markets and product markets.9 Michael Burawoy, one of the major living sociologists, created a three-way classification, involving ‘despotic control’ (direct control), ‘hegemonic control’ (more sophisticated methods relating to bureaucratic control)10 and ‘hegemonic despotism’. The last meant the fear of being fired was replaced by the fear of capital flight, plant closure, the transfer of operations and disinvestme\n",

Introduction The intersection of the digital with our work and leisure, and the blurring of these two categories, has become an increasingly significant field of inquiry in Big Data capitalism. Digital labour studies – in which this nexus is explored – is fast becoming a field of its own, incorporating analyses of workers in the platform-mediated gig economy, users of social media, social media influenc- ers, and the ways in which various work practices are being re-shaped by digital technologies. The importance of this field lies in how the dynamics it traces – such as the centrality of immaterial/affective labour, precarious and exploited work conditions and the social factory – are emblematic of wider trends in contemporary capitalism. In early 2016, I published Feminism, Labour and Digital Media: The Digital Housewife, which contributes to this debate by arguing a case for using Marxist How to cite this book chapter: Jarrett, K. 2019.

By ‘consumer labour,’ I mean the myriad ways in which our cultural products are expropriated and alienated from us when we upload them to platforms, but also how our data is the cornerstone of surplus value generation for digital media companies. The book sought to ad- dress what I considered a fruitless debate about whether such work is alienated and exploited or socially meaningful and a site for self-actualisation. In The Digital Housewife, I argue that domestic work, as conceptualised by Marxist feminists, gives us a model of work that is both these things – integral to capi- talism for its productive and reproductive capacity, but always potentially out- side these same dynamics. Domestic work is labour that straddles the cultural and the economic, and thus, I argue, it gives us a mechanism for understanding forms of digital labour that perform the same feat of gymnastics. My book is quite narrowly targeted at a particular theoretical concern – and personal bugbear – and focuses on only a limited range of digital labour prac- tices in making its case. Nevertheless, the central principles from which its ar- guments are drawn have begun growing in importance in the study of digital labour and capitalism more broadly. In this chapter, I want to move away from the specific argument in my book and instead focus on this wider context. I will engage with wider conversations about activism, struggle and critique into which its argument has entered, and attempt to identify contexts where the emphasis on alternative labour histories and the politics of social reproduc- tion that animates my book brings important critical insight. Along the way, I’ll describe some elements of The Digital Housewife, but mostly as a means of illustrating what bringing reproductive work into view can do for our under- standing of contemporary capitalism and its sites of struggle. I will do this by focusing on three key areas: history, value and subjects. 2. History One of the orienting feminist concepts in my book is that the social factory has a longer history than is usually ascribed to it in studies of digital capitalism. The argument is often made that we live in times marked by a peculiar saturation of the whole of existence with the dictates of capital – the real subsumption of life that constitutes Mario Tronti’s (1973) social factory. This is often attributed to the conditions of post-Fordism and the information-intensive industries of Big Data capitalism. There is often an implicit assumption that the circum- stances of the social factory are new. However, for anyone who is not a white, cis-, het- man, it is difficult to see precisely what is novel about the conditions in which all of life is subsumed into capital. Private domestic space and interpersonal relations, including sexual activity, have historically been considered outside capital, providing arenas in which autonomous self-making could happen, and where Marx’s species-being', 'Through the Reproductive Lens 105 could be realised. In white hetero-patriarchal contexts this has long been equated with the private, domestic space of the nuclear family (Berlant and Warner 1998; England 1993; Osucha 2009). Yet women, people of colour, and LGBTQ+ have never experienced such contexts as places of autonomy or agency but rather as venues of (en)forced and uncompensated work, as well as situations of domination and surveillance. Moreover, as Marxist feminists such as Dalla Costa and James (1975), Federici (2004), Mies et al. (1988) and Davis (1983) assert, gender, raced and sexed being and the organisation of labour are intimately related, placing human subjectivity at the core of capitalist accumu- lation. Taking these perspectives into account, the absorption of the whole of life – the existence of a social factory – is a fundamental, if not foundational, part of the capitalist narrative. An example of this longer history of the social factory that I have explored (Jarrett 2017) is the effective slave labour system of the Magdalene Laundries in Ireland between 1922 and 1937. These laundries were carceral institutions where women believed dangerous to the middle-class ‘stem-family system’ (In- glis 1997, 13) through sexual activity outside of patriarchal marriage, deemed ‘unproductive’ through poverty (Buckley 2016), or otherwise considered un- ruly by behavioural norms of the day were sent for penance and re-education into domestic labour discipline. Women slaved in abject conditions in these nun-run commercial, but non-profit, laundries for no pay, typically for years. The Magdalene Laundries, though, are not merely an aberration of Irish Ca- tholicism, but must be read as part of a society-wide social, cultural, legal and political machinery supporting a state economic agenda to get men – but spe- cifically men – back to work in a very weak economy (Daly 1995). This was achieved through an aggressive re-instatement of the gendered division of la- bour, both materially – in the forms of regulations controlling women’s labour and political rights – and culturally, through sermonising, cultural products and the disciplining effect of institutions like the Laundries. These sites en- forced women’s domesticity by disciplining and policing women’s bodies, sexu- ality and ‘souls,’ exacting penance to ensure alignment with their constrained economic roles. Based on a ‘thematic of sin’ (Inglis 1997) and regimes of shame, the cultural logics that animated these institutions and which gave legitimacy to their economic effects did not end at the Laundry gate. They were also artic- ulated in the sensibilities of all in Irish society, as evidenced by claims that key advocates of the Magdalene system were women (Crowley and Kitchen 2008). The Laundries, and their embedding in everyday Irish society, exemplify the idea of the social factory – a society, a cultural fabric and individual embodied subjectivities formed by an economic agenda. Such examples of the long history of capitalist logics manifesting in non-market contexts suggest that if we are to understand labour in Big Data capitalism, it is vital to recover and incorporate labour histories that do not be- long to white men in industrialised labour (see also Fuchs 2017). As Alan Sears (2016, 139) summarises, different members of the working class ‘face different', '106 Digital Objects, Digital Subjects forms of autonomy and coercion based on their location within dominant di- visions of labour organised around differentiated processes of dispossession’. To understand capitalism holistically we therefore need to know more about the histories (and present experiences) of women, people of colour, trans or LGBTQ+ people, and people with disabilities, whose experiences in capital are marked by saturated regimes of precariousness and oppression. The overt re- lationship of these subaltern labour conditions to the immersive politics of the social factory suggests that they usefully map the experiences of oppression found in the precarious social factories of Big Data capitalism. One suite of labour experiences we need to engage with more effectively and extensively is that of paid and unpaid sex work, which Morgane Merteuil (2017) has argued offers valuable insight into contemporary labour relations in Big Data capitalism. Using camming – webcam-based sex work – as her example, she describes a relationship between the dynamics of sex work and platforms such as Uber or Taskrabbit. Platforms, Merteuil argues, function similarly to pimps in that they broker exchanges between worker and client, take a cut of any profits, and also provide certain rules for how labour is to be performed. Merteuil argues that rather than the digital housewife that I propose, it is the digital whore that provides the best model for understanding labour in plat- form economies. But the analogy runs deeper than the neat comparison between platforms and pimps. If we examine the long history of sex work, in particular by women and women of colour, we see very blurry distinctions between intimacy and econ- omy, between paid and unpaid work, between agency and control. When your core business is to ‘marry well,’ then even unpaid sex with your life partner has an economic logic. It is the common and ongoing negotiations of these bound- aries in interpersonal, legal, political and economic\n",

            "['12 Creative Precarity in the Adult Film Industry Heather Berg and Constance Penley In this chapter, we examine the conditions of precarity in porn work, situating those conditions in the context of a changing industry and a political economic moment in which uncertainty is the most stable feature. Though we can link pre- carious conditions to their social contexts, we do not suggest that such conditions are inevitable or historically neutral. As Chuck Kleinhans insists, “Precarity is not a necessary result of [global political economic] changes. Rather, it is a deliberate policy and aspect of neoliberalism in its relation to the labor force.”1 Porn work- ers’ precarity emerges out of an industry struggling in the wake of global reces- sion, rampant piracy, and a hostile legal environment, but precaritizing policies are not a necessary response to these socio-political conditions. Instead, deliber- ate policies make porn workers precarious—policies ranging from independent contractor laws that excuse employers from labor regulations and proscribe union organizing, to formal and informal anti–sex worker codes that render sex workers especially vulnerable to both state and employer abuse, and of course, the mun- dane but not inevitable rules of the wage relation under capital. We are equally interested in creative precarity—the resourceful ways porn work- ers resist, navigate, and exploit the precarity they confront. We suggest that taking seriously these forms of resistance can deepen our understanding of precarious labor in creative fields and in the world of work more broadly. Why? Because the conditions of precarity that appear to be recent historical developments in other industries have long shaped porn work. The “new gig economy [emphasis added],” brought on by “massive changes that have generated the expansion of precarious employment,” is not, for instance, so new for porn workers, who have long pursued diversified income streams to get by.2 The adult film industry is not exceptional, 159', '160 Heather Berg and Constance Penley then, but it may be predictive. Workers’ struggles there speak to the conditions that increasingly characterize labor in the current political economy, and we are well served to pay attention to the strategies they deploy in confronting them. We must begin by mapping the adult film industry, because so little is known about it, and what is thought to be known—such as the oft-repeated claim that it is a $10–12 billion industry—turns out to be completely made up though almost never challenged. The establishment of porn studies as a scholarly discipline— with the inauguration of the journal Porn Studies in 2013, the growing number of university courses offered and dissertations undertaken, the availability of more archives and collections for historical research, and the efforts of academics and industry professionals to engage in productive conversations about the current and future shape of the industry—helps make this mapping possible. The Feminist Porn Book: The Politics of Producing Pleasure is the first collection, for example, to bring together writings by feminists in the adult industry and essays by femi- nist porn scholars.3 But even as space opens up for academic discussions of por- nography, the casualization of the professoriate and the erosion of the academic freedom ensured by tenure bring their own precarity to researching controversial areas such as the adult industry. CONTOURS OF THE INDUSTRY Though increasingly diffuse, the adult film industry occupies a central role in the spatial and political economy of California’s San Fernando Valley. We focus our inquiry there in the interests of space and precision, while also attending to the growing production centers of Las Vegas, San Francisco, south Florida, and globally, Brazil and Eastern Europe. A small roster of production and distribution companies, including Manwin, Bang Brothers, Brazzers, West Coast Productions, Evil Angel, Wicked Pictures, Larry Flynt Productions, Playboy Enterprises, and Vivid Entertainment, dominates the adult film industry landscape. But as produc- tion costs rise and potential profits from large-scale productions decrease,4 small, boutique production companies producing niche content increasingly populate the adult film industry. In using the term industry, we do not suggest a monolithic, static, or internally consistent body. Instead, we mean to indicate the dynamic networks of workers, management, and institutions that take part in the produc- tion process of adult film, all of which are affected by regulatory policies such as Measure B, the 2012 Los Angeles County mandatory condom law that saw more than a 90 percent drop in adult film production permits issued. Studio executives, investors, producers, talent agents, directors, crew, perform- ers, postproduction editors, and distribution and marketing staff are key players in adult film production. Common institutions connect these actors: trade pub- lications distribute industry news and host annual trade and award shows; the', 'Creative Precarity in the Adult Film Industry 161 industry’s trade organization, the Free Speech Coalition, lobbies on its behalf and, since the 2010 collapse of what had been an industry-run health clinic, sets the terms for recommended sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing panels and exposure protocols; the Adult Performer Advocacy Committee (APAC), since the fall of 2013, provides worker education such as the Porn 101 video and brings per- formers together to advocate on their own behalf in discussions of testing proto- cols and other informal policies; and private but industry-specific testing clinics clear performers for work. Other institutions and actors, while not of the porn industry, are intimately connected to it: multinational software development firms design web platforms and process credit card payments, real estate agents coordi- nate filming locations, beauty service providers specialize in readying performers for work, publicity firms cater to performers and adult businesses, and nonprofit organizations such as the Aids Healthcare Foundation build political identities and funding bases through their relationships with (or stark opposition to) the indus- try. In describing the contours of the “industry,” we think it is important to include organizations and institutions that could not exist without the adult industry, such as for-profit “porn addiction” therapies, religious antiporn initiatives like the XXX- CHURCH, which sends its preachers on the college circuit to debate with porn stars (“Jesus loves porn stars!”), and the antiporn feminists who spend extraordi- nary amounts of time and energy fighting not only the adult industry but those who think it merits study rather than blanket condemnation (Stop Porn Culture). We also understand the “industry” to encompass the satellite industries— including erotic dance, webcam, escort, and novelty—that enjoy a symbiotic rela- tionship with the adult film industry. This relationship has three dimensions: first, income streams from satellite industries economically sustain adult film perform- ers, securing a reserve army of performer labor for whom the film industry is not financially responsible. Were such income streams not available, it would be difficult if not impossible for performers to maintain themselves amid the vicis- situdes of demand, filming schedules, industry, and other factors that mean a performer might work twenty days one month and two the next.5 Second, many performers describe the increased earnings they can draw from satellite industries by marketing themselves as “porn stars” as a primary reason for taking on porn performance.6 Dominic Ace, an adult industry publicist and photographer who has worked as a roadie for performers on feature dancing tours, explained it this way: “You’ve got web sites, you’ve got Skype shows, you’ve got privates [escorting], you’ve got fan clubs, you’ve got custom videos, appearances, feature dancing, Veri- fied Call [a service that connects fans to performers via cell phone], a ton of differ- ent revenue streams. . . . You don’t make money doing scenes, a scene is a marketing tool [emphasis added].”7 Talent agents for film frequently recruit in erotic dance clubs and on webcam sites, and adult actresses report having begun careers in these fields, later moving into the film industry. Finally, production companies', '162 Heather Berg and Constance Penley and agents who sign performers to exclusive contracts may be, depending on the specific terms of the contract, entitled to a percentage of workers’ earnings in satel- lite industries. Porn workers push the boundaries of the industry to meet their financial needs, as well as satisfy desires for autonomy, flexibility, and work-life balance. Porn per- former and single parent Raylene explained that her average take from three to five hours of webcamming work was comparable to her film performance rate, but webcamming allowed her to have greater control over her schedule and working environment: “I was able to work alone, in my house, during school hours, and then, you know, have the rest of the evening with my child and make a better living at home than when I was in front of the camera.”8 Those performers who prefer sat- ellite industries to adult filmmaking describe taking just enough film gigs to main- tain their “brands.” In line with Dominic Ace’s description of scenes as “marketing tool[s],” performer Venus Lux noted, “When you’re in porn, especially transsexual porn, it’s not a money making thing. It’s for the fame, that’s it. The chain reaction of the fame means you can eventually get money.”9 Management too is keenly aware of the industry’s reliance on satellite industries. Christian Mann, a longtime board member of the industry’s trade organization and general manager of distribution giant Evil Angel, compared the porn industry’s inc\n",

            "[\"Picturing placelessness: Online graphic narratives and Australia's refugee 4 detention centres Aaron Humphrey Introduction This chapter will examine an online comic published by the Global Mail, 'At Work Inside our Detention Centres: A Guard's Story' (Olle & Wallman 2014), which documents the difficult situations faced by asylum seekers who have been detained by the Australian government. Asylum seekers face the dilemma of placelessness on political, psychological and phenomenological levels, and the comic affectively conveys this dilemma to its readers by employing elements of the visual language of online communication used in social networking. An analysis of the comic demonstrates how online communication can also be characterised as engendering placelessness, although in a significantly subtler and less perilous way than seeking political asylum. This discussion is significant because the media that we use to communicate are strongly tied to our understanding of place as a political, physical and phenomenological experience. For example, the modern conception of national identities was shaped\", \"Making Publics, Making Places in part by the industries of print, particularly novels and newspapers (Anderson 1997), which were able to connect people across relatively long distances, while Marshall McLuhan suggested that broadcast technologies of radio and television helped to shape a 'global village' where physical boundaries could be largely transcended (1964). Although advances in communication technologies have largely served to extend our political sense of place, theorists of place, such as Edward Relph and Melvin Webber, have argued that our phenomenological sense of place is being eroded by the industrial emphasis on accessibility and efficiency. Webber (1964) noted the rise of urban 'nonplaces' such as warehouses, loading docks and freeway overpasses crisscrossed with telephone wires, while Relph (1976, p. 143) described the alienation that humans experience in these kinds of 'anonymous spaces and exchangeable environments'. Although Relph and Webber were writing in the mid-twentieth century, their theories are even more applicable now. Digital technologies are further streamlining communication, and social media platforms are increasingly aggregating and decontextualising content. This phenomenological collapse of place is exemplified in the way most social media platforms present an infinite scroll of standardised content drawn from disparate sources. The simultaneous expansion of place in a political sense can be seen in the way visual communication like emoji and memes are able to bypass language barriers that have historically played a crucial role in national identities. While online Figure 4.1: Illustration from 'A Guard's Story'. Source: S Wallman, 18 Feburary 2014, Global Mail. Reproduced with permission. 50\", \"Making Publics, Making Places communication has made national and place-based identities more porous, there have also been retrenchments of national political boundaries, as seen particularly in the response of countries like Australia to the current refugee crisis. Users of social media may experience a phenomenological alienation from a sense of place, but refugees who are unable to find political asylum face a much more profound and potentially deadly alienation. 'A Guard's Story' conveyed the profound placelessness of asylum seekers in a way that resonated strongly with Australian readers, in part by leveraging the placeless qualities of online communication which Australian readers were deeply familiar with. To explore the implications of this kind of communication, this chapter will first discuss how 'A Guard's Story' can be understood in terms of the changing and increasingly placeless online media landscape. This will be followed by a discussion of the Australian government's asylum seeker policies, and a critique of how these policies have been reported by traditional text-based and broadcast news media. Finally, an analysis of 'A Guard's Story' will show how it departs from earlier representations of asylum seekers to present a different conception of citizenship, place and placelessness. Placelessess of online communication The way that the Global Mail published 'A Guard's Story' and how it was shared by readers exemplifies how online communication is changing, particularly in regards to journalism, both in terms of becoming more visually based and more reliant on audiences sharing content through social networks. The Global Mail was funded philanthropically by Graeme Wood, and received many awards for the quality of its journalism, but despite partnerships with larger commercial sites like the Guardian and Time, its audience remained relatively small. In 2014, after two years of operation, Wood withdrew his funding, despite having initially pledged support for five years, and the website subsequently closed in February of the same year. As the Global Mail 's offices were being vacated, a handful of employees scrambled to get 'A Guard's Story' uploaded to the server. 'A Guard's Story' was not only the Global Mail 's first comic, it was also its last article in any form, published so late into the site's death throes that it was not even hyperlinked from anywhere else in the site. It existed like a ghost on the site: accessible if you had the URL, but otherwise unmentioned. At the last moment, a single link to the comic surfaced on the Global Mail 's Facebook account. 'A Guard's Story' represents both the visual shift in online content (as seen elsewhere in the growth of online comics journalism, along with the popular usage of GIFS, memes and emoji in all kinds of discourse) and the increasing use of social media platforms as a tool for publishing and sharing information. The main way that readers found 'A Guard's Story' was through sites like Facebook and Twitter, as it could not be accessed from anywhere else on the Global Mail 's website. 51\", \"Making Publics, Making Places Figure 4.2: Illustration from 'A Guard's Story'. Source: S Wallman, 18 Feburary 2014, Global Mail. Reproduced with permission. Through these platforms it attracted the kind of readership that the site had struggled to generate in its two years of operation. Thousands of readers found 'A Guard's Story' on Facebook, where it was shared more than 56 000 times. Even though the Global Mail soon stopped monitoring its Facebook page, comments from enthusiastic readers quickly piled up, like letters shoved under the door of a closed storefront. 'That moved me to tears', wrote one reader, while another seemed almost evangelical: 'Print it! Print 1,000s of them I'll hand them out on street corners!' (in Jeffrey 2012). In some ways, sharing links on social media has become the digital version of handing out pamphlets on street corners. The use of the city streets as conduits for communication was enabled by what Melvin Webber (1964) characterised as urban 'nonplaces', the generic and standardised spaces of industrialisation where accessibility is prioritised over proximity and propinquity. Social networks like Facebook and Twitter have remediated these networks of 'nonplaces', building upon digital, networked technologies that have dramatically increased the accessibility of information beyond what Webber could have conceived. They have also increased the 'placelessness' of information and communication (for example, Aguirre & Davies 2015; Odom, Zimmerman & Forlizzi 2014; Ogawa et al. 2013), resulting in an erosion of what Mahyar Arefi has called 'the communal ties and bonds that were once considered the 52\", \"Making Publics, Making Places main characteristics of place-bound communities', as 'communities of interest' replace 'communities of place' (1999, p. 181). The placeless quality of much online communication, and certainly of the sharing of articles like 'A Guard's Story' on Facebook, is paralleled in the way 'A Guard's Story' depicts detention centres themselves as floating in a placeless kind of limbo. Placelessness can be understood through the theoretical framework developed by Edward Relph in Place and Placelessness (1976). Relph suggested that 'place' can be understood both in terms of how people create identities of places as unique and particular, and how people identify with those places and see themselves as either outside or inside them. For Relph, placelessness arises when the distinctive characteristics of places are removed and replaced with standardised features: 'a replacement of the diverse and significant places of the world with anonymous spaces and exchangeable environments' (p. 143). This process, often driven by 'the overriding concern with efficiency as an end in itself', undermines the abilities of both individuals and cultures to locate their identities in relation to a place (Seamon & Sowers 2008, p. 46). Of course, it bears repeating that the placelessness that asylum seekers face is much more immediate and life-threatening. The next section will discuss how government policies and media reporting have participated in the construction of this kind of placelessness. Placelessness of asylum seekers Since refugees are people who are fleeing from one place to another and who 'occupy the realm of the stateless' (Binaisa 2011, p. 523), the issue of asylum seekers is deeply connected to the conception of places as having physical, political and affective aspects. The Australian government has attempted to deter asylum seekers by denying them access to Australia on all three of these levels. An example of denying access to Australia as political space has been the erosion of Australia's 'Migration Zone', a space that granted particular political rights to those who crossed into its physical boundary. Established by the Migration Act 1958, the Migration Zone initially encompassed the entire physical territory of Australia. In 2001 the Howard government's 'Pacific solution' excised thousan\n",

            "['Learning from the health scale up under the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) How global health moved towards the MDGs Working Paper October 27, 2019 Guido Schmidt-Traub Executive Director Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), France Abstract The health sector has mounted the most coordinated, sophisticated, and ultimately successful campaigns and partnerships to pursue the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). As part of a global partnership without central coordination, global and national organizations collaborated in pursuit of the goals. This paper identifies five components of this global partnership: (i) shared goals and metrics, (ii) back-castings and policy standards, (iii) international funding mechanisms and national implementation, (iv) evidence-based advocacy, and (v) a strong evidence base, monitoring & evaluation, and technology development. Other priorities under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as education, smallholder farming, and access to basic infrastructure lack similar partnerships and organization. The paper proposes how, drawing on the experiences of the health sector, these sectors can strengthen their organization in pursuit of the SDGs. Just as happened in global health in the early 2000s, private philanthropy and development funders can help close implementation gaps that inhibit faster progress towards the SDGs. The author is grateful for advice and comments provided by Jeffrey D. Sachs, Chandrika Bahadur, Jessica Espey, Cecil Haverkamp, and John W. McArthur. The views expressed in this working paper may not represent the views of the SDSN or its Leadership Council. 1', 'About the SDSN The UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) mobilizes scientific and technical expertise from academia, civil society, and the private sector to support practical problem solving for sustainable development at local, national, and global scales. The SDSN has been operating since 2012 under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General. The SDSN is building national and regional networks of knowledge institutions, solution-focused thematic networks, and the SDG Academy, an online university for sustainable development. 2', 'MDGs (Kassebaum et al., 2014), nutrition (Bhutta et al., 2013), or achieve health convergence by 2035 (Jamison et al., 2013). These commissions played a central role in synthesizing and documenting the evidence base for how complex goals could be achieved in different country settings. Due to the high impact factor of The Lancet, large numbers of leading researchers and professionals trained their sights on tackling the implementation challenges for achieving the MDGs. Other partnerships were created to tackle specific implementation challenges. For example, the Stop TB Partnership standardized DOTS treatment protocols for application around the world and enlisted private industry to tackle the challenges of multi-drug-resistant TB (Stop TB Partnership, 2000). UNICEF, UNFPA, and many others have promoted essential child health packages, defined the core interventions for sexual and reproductive health, as well as maternal and newborn health. These global efforts to inventory tools, standardize treatment protocols, and establish global standards enabled an unprecedented diffusion of knowledge and technologies in a short period of time. Another driver for implementation research was funding from the Global Fund for program evaluation. This enabled researchers to test the efficacy of interventions and programs at national scales. For example, implementation research from a Global Fund-supported program in Kenya helped shape the global consensus for the need to distribute LINs for free or at highly subsidized prices (WHO, 2007b). Similarly, changes in treatment guidelines for HIV/AIDS were informed by implementation research from Global Fund-supported programs in Africa and elsewhere (WHO, 2016). Finally, the back-castings for health goals and lessons from implementation research revealed a number of technology gaps that the health sector then set out to fill. For example, in response to growing resistance to quinine, ACT was developed in a short period of time to reduce the risk of resistance to artemisinin, which had been developed by China. The fight against malaria also required simpler and faster diagnostic tools. With support from the Gates Foundation, major research and development efforts were launched that led to the introduction and adoption of new rapid diagnostic tests within a few years (Zhao et al., 2012). Industry developed low-cost production techniques for LINs and other medicines drawing on consensus lists of technology gaps (Kaplan et al., 2013). Throughout the Gates Foundation played a central role in identifying key technology gaps and promoting innovation through its generous funding to public-private partnerships for technology development. This includes bets on long-term technological breakthroughs, such as a malaria vaccine. 2. Lessons from the health partnership Starting in the early 2000s, the health sector has strengthened and expanded a global goal-based partnership that comprises many international and national organizations, which collaborate without central coordination or guidance. Without this ecosystem of organizations pursuing a shared global agenda, poor countries would not have experienced the rapid acceleration in improving health outcomes under the MDGs. While national governments bear the ultimate responsibility for achieving development objectives, the health experience suggests that a global partnership can play a critical role in meeting time-bound goals. The development community needs to consider how lessons from health might be applied to other sectors like education, water and sanitation, agriculture and food security, or energy access. Clearly, no 14', 'two sectors face the same challenges, but the five components of the global partnership for health provide a framework for identifying gaps and asking how a sector can accelerate progress towards the SDGs. Here is a list of key questions that other sectors might consider to identify priorities for consideration by governments, civil society, business, philanthropists, development finance institutions, and international organizations. 1. Shared goals and metrics: • Have broad international goals, such as the SDGs, been translated into transparent, medium-term targets shared by the entire sector? Are the responsible UN organizations, major civil society organizations, and other partners supporting these goals? • Are available metrics, such as the official SDG indicators, adequate for tracking progress towards the targets? If such metrics and/or supporting data do not exist, might an organization like the Gates-funded Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) be needed? 2. Back-castings and Policy Standards: • Does the sector have detailed global back-castings for how the international goals can be achieved, including a full analysis of financing needs? • Does the sector have a (formal or informal) mechanism for adopting global policy standards and guidance on implementation like the World Health Assembly? 3. Adequate Funding and National Implementation: • Does the sector have one or more funding mechanisms that can a. provide needs-based national-scale funding based on independent technical review, b. provide funding directly to government and other non-government organizations to promote innovation and effectiveness in different country settings, and c. promote independent evaluation and implementation research? 4. Evidence-based Advocacy: • Does the sector have independently funded advocacy organizations and watchdogs? • How can academics and other researchers be mobilized to work on how the goals can be achieved? 5. Applied Research, Monitoring & Evaluation and Technology Development: • Does the sector have a top-rated peer-reviewed journal like The Lancet or BMJ that publishes research on the effectiveness of interventions and cross-disciplinary research on how to achieve complex goals? • How can the sector support small-scale demonstration projects to test new interventions or delivery models? • How can the sector support the systematic evaluations of evidence on the efficacy of interventions? How can gaps in available technologies be identified and prioritized? Might the Cochrane Collaboration Group provide an organizational model? 15', '3. The example of education A highly preliminary application of these questions to education might reveal the following: As part of the SDGs, the education sector has committed to achieving universal secondary completion, but this goal lacks an operational definition. It is not clear whether the goal refers to upper or lower secondary completion. Equally importantly, the sector lacks clear mid-term goals for learning outcomes by field (e.g. literacy and numeracy) and level (e.g. pre-school, primary, lower and upper secondary). In the absence of such outcome standards, the sector is unable to pursue a goal-based approach. Closely, related, education also lacks a well-documented production function (Pritchett, 2013) and an evidence base that is as comprehensive and rigorous as in health. Recently, the RISE Program has been aiming to fill this gap (RISE, 2018). Critically, there is currently no equivalent in education for The Lancet or the BMJ that might foster a sustained applied research debate on how to achieve the SDG on education. So the sector is not building out and propagating the implementation knowledge that is required for a ‘delivery revolution’ along the lines of what the health sector experienced following the adoption of ‘3 by 5’. Meanwhile, the education sector has made some progress in improving outcome measures and collecting more data, but it remains far behind the health sector in terms of metrics and data availability. No consensus exists on what constitutes internationally comparable d\n",

            "['4. Stakeholder Engagement to Inform the Culture of Health Action Framework As described in Chapter Two, several inputs informed the framework and drivers, including stakeholder input from national and global leaders on the action framework, action areas, and drivers. While the full findings from stakeholder engagement are summarized in Stakeholder Perspectives on a Culture of Health: Key Findings (Acosta et al., 2015), we briefly describe key themes here that informed the action areas and the selection of drivers. Stakeholder engagement served three primary purposes: (1) to support the conceptual development of the Culture of Health framework, including selection of drivers; (2) to support the planning for the naturalistic observations of sentinel communities during the Culture of Health implementation processes (described in Chapter Ten); and (3) to support the identification, development, and use of Culture of Health measures. Stakeholder engagement activities included • interviews with RWJF partner communities in the United States • interviews in U.S. communities that were not necessarily RWJF partners, as well as in non-U.S. communities • “concept mapping” (a technique to delineate the underlying constructs of a given concept) within communities and within health and non-health sectors. In the next sections, we describe key findings from the interviews and the concept-mapping activities from communities. Key Principles of Stakeholder Engagement Stakeholder engagement efforts were guided by two key methods. First, we utilized both literature and RWJF staff reviews and experience to inform the development of all protocols guiding stakeholder engagement. This included building on the expertise that RWJF’s staff and consultants have developed through participation in similar initiatives (e.g., County Health Rankings). Second, the team balanced an evidence-informed perspective and a creative and free elicitation process to promote open dialogue with stakeholders. To operationalize this balance, we used stakeholder engagement activities that began with the definition of Culture of Health 37', '(see Chapter One), as well as free elicitation activities that were guided by open-ended questions. These guiding principles helped us ensure that stakeholder engagement activities were evidence- informed, yet flexible enough to encourage open dialogue. Types of Stakeholders We strategically convened stakeholders across the continuum of perspectives, from stakeholders who may be new to concepts related to the Culture of Health to stakeholders who may be leading the country in implementing cutting-edge Culture of Health initiatives. We focused on three types of stakeholders (shown in order of the continuum from most cutting edge to new to the Culture of Health concepts): Cutting-edge Culture of (1) community leaders representing foundations or other well- Health implementers being and resilience groups that were implementing cutting-edge Culture of Health initiatives across a community (2) innovative organization leaders who were implementing cutting-edge Culture of Health initiatives (e.g., linking economic New to Culture of development with health promotion) within their organization Health concepts (3) organizational representatives from relevant sectors. Interviews were conducted with stakeholders in 13 communities: Boston, Mass.; Denver, Colo.; Detroit, Mich.; Kansas City, Kan., and Kansas City, Mo.; Los Angeles, Calif.; Louisville, Ky.; Minneapolis, Minn.; New Orleans, La.; Oakland, Calif.; Portland, Oreg.; Sacramento, Calif.; Seattle, Wash.; and Washington, D.C. These communities were chosen because they had organizations engaged in multiple and diverse Culture of Health initiatives, included a mix of health-related community rankings (e.g., high- and low-rated communities according to health outcomes and health factors outlined in RWJF’s county health rankings, high- and low-rated communities according to the American Fitness Index), and represented diverse geographic regions. Initially, snowball sampling was used to identify stakeholders. As a starting point, RWJF provided a table of all the foundation’s current and former grantees since 2009. The RAND team narrowed that list down to grantees who were part of national RWJF grant programs, such as Communities Creating Healthy Environments, Leadership for Healthy Communities, Response 38', 'to Economic Hard Times, Active Living by Design, Healthy Kids Healthy Communities, Aligning Forces for Quality, and Roadmaps to Health. In addition, the team considered grantees from other national Culture of Health–type programs, such as the California Endowment’s Building Healthy Communities program, and reached out to experts within RAND for suggestions, resulting in a list of 95 communities that were associated with at least one of these initiatives. RAND and RWJF staff reviewed these communities to narrow the list to a smaller set of communities that reflected broad geographic representation, as well as social and demographic diversity. In addition, the research team sought to include communities that were engaged in multiple health-supporting initiatives in order to attract stakeholders with a broad range of experiences. This process was used to identify stakeholders from 12 of the communities. For the 13th community, Washington, D.C., a researcher attended three Mayor’s Health in All Policies task force meetings and held individual discussions with key stakeholders participating in the task force. From this list, the research team selected three organizations from each community for initial interviews. The team selected organizations and programs that represented a broad diversity of initiatives, organization types, and populations served and whose work included efforts that addressed building a Culture of Health. The team also included different organization types and content areas from those covered with the first 13 community stakeholder communities. Organizations in which a team member had a direct contact were prioritized because of a higher level of confidence that the organization’s work related to the Culture of Health and the greater likelihood of completing interviews with these organizations within the time frame for data collection. Of note, 53 percent of stakeholders came from the western United States, which may have been a limitation of our snowball sampling approach. We do not believe that unnecessary bias factored into the review based on the geographic distribution, but we did ensure that we included other expert input (e.g., from the RWJF professional network described earlier) from the eastern and southern regions. Further, concept-mapping activities were disproportionately conducted in those regions to balance out the stakeholder interviews. International Stakeholders These stakeholders were purposively sampled from a larger list of organizations generated by the RAND team. This larger list consisted of organizations identified by (1) nominations from 39', 'the team of health-focused and/or community-serving organizations gleaned from their personal experience and professional networks, (2) referrals and nominations by non-RAND researchers based in the geographic regions of interest (e.g., we solicited ideas from researchers who focused on health and well-being in other nations, using our study team networks), and (3) Internet searches for organizations using the keywords “Culture of Health,” “health in all policies,” “well-being,” and “resilience.” From this list, the research team then selected a sample for each region (e.g., Global South, Asia), aiming for diversity across these factors: • organization type (e.g., community-based nonprofits, clinics, foundations) • geographic focus (international, national, regional, local, neighborhood) • health and well-being target (e.g., social determinants; a specific disease topic, such as cancer or HIV; or a specific approach, such as increasing access to care or improving quality of care) • population served (e.g., children, women, or racial and ethnic minorities) • geographic location • coverage of the four Culture of Health action areas. Key Themes from Interviews and Focus Groups While more detail on stakeholder themes is provided in Acosta et al., 2015, we briefly summarize key themes here. All four Culture of Health action areas were well represented in the work pursued in many of the communities reviewed (see examples in Table 4.1). Some key themes are noted below. • Making health a shared value: Stakeholders were taking advantage of existing enthusiasm in their communities toward promoting health in diverse ways and embedding “health in all policies.” They also used a variety of organizing and community-building strategies to increase a sense of social cohesion and to support Culture of Health initiatives and programs. They noted, however, that community expectations about the value of health varied widely, and community participation in advancing well-being was important, yet often lacking. • Cross-sector collaboration to improve well-being: In multiple communities, local and state governments were leading efforts to build a Culture of Health. Also, stakeholders were collaborating with partners from diverse sectors, and partnerships among health care centers, local businesses and business organizations, academic institutions, nonprofits, 40', 'and faith-based organizations were leading to creative approaches for dealing with health issues. Stakeholders noted that it was not the number but the quality of partnerships that mattered. They also highlighted that policies that supported maintenance of collaboration were needed. • Creating healthier, more equitable communities: Most communities were home to at least one program aiming to improve access to healthy eating and physical activity, with many such programs focusing on community and school gardens, as well as walking and biking.

            "['10. A Glass Half Full... Australian women’s health activists, in their long quest for the changes that will improve women’s health—and the health of the whole population—have reason to feel both gratification and disappointment. For although they can lay claim to remarkable achievements, some of the most important goals are yet to be achieved. Moreover, along the way, crucially important opportunities for structural health reform have been missed. In the early days, movement members identified a set of problems, many of them rarely discussed in public, and then worked persistently until community attitudes shifted, decision makers took notice and policy responses were made. As a result, new laws and new programs to advance women’s health were devised and funded across the country. The movement itself set up an infrastructure of community-based healthcare centres and services to support women in their daily lives and at times of distress and crisis. This infrastructure serves as an institutional base for the movement, supporting intelligence gathering, information sharing, policy development and advocacy work. Taking up the health reform ideas of the 1970s and applying a gender lens, the concept of a social health perspective was developed and disseminated. Arguably, wider understanding and acceptance of the social view of health is the movement’s most important accomplishment. Unfamiliar in the early 1970s when the comprehensiveness of hospital and medical services was rarely questioned, the social perspective now explicitly informs most Commonwealth, State and Territory health policy documents. On the other side of the ledger, the women’s health sector has always been seriously under-funded, which has restricted its capacity to meet immediate needs and to develop innovative and collaborative health-promoting strategies. It also restricts its capacity to expand its constituency because, being thinly scattered, only a few women can have access to the services it provides. While the mainstream health system has responded to some aspects of the feminist critique, it remains heavily centred on the medical model, with its focus on treatment services. The best-practice models of preventive health care developed in the community sector have not yet had a system-wide impact, mostly because structural incentives steer provision in the direction of high-turnover treatment services. Health reform has been high on the national agenda since 2007, where policy documents recognise social determinants and talk about the importance of prevention. Yet proposals to strengthen primary health care—the locus of any significant preventative effort—have so far been restricted to supporting the services provided in general practitioners’ surgeries on a fee-for-service basis. The 1970s vision of a holistic, prevention-focused, primary healthcare system is still the stuff of dreams. 305', 'Reaching for Health Nevertheless, innovative models of practice continue to be developed in the small community-based worlds of women’s health, Aboriginal health and community health. The States and Territories, within the limited finance available to them, are generating innovative approaches to primary health care through partnerships and collaborations with the community sector and others. And after a small injection of extra funding that came with the Emergency Response, policymakers in the Northern Territory’s Aboriginal medical services are leading the way in Australian health reform, as the Aboriginal health movement led the way in the 1970s. This concluding chapter looks at the achievements of the women’s health movement and the goals that are still to be reached. It then examines the reasons that structural reform has been so hard to achieve, returning to the last question posed in the introduction: why, despite the wealth of evidence and the advocacy of women and other public health reformers, have the key structures of the health system remained virtually unchanged since the 1970s? Two Steps Forward At the local level, in female-run centres and services, women participate in health decision making, which is held to be the gold standard by health experts. The services provided are highly valued by those who use them, particularly by disadvantaged and marginalised women. Primary prevention undertakings, infrequently available in the hospital and medical systems, are tailored to meet local needs. Self-help is supported, health literacy is promoted and group programs are developed. Support and referral services and community- development projects are part of everyday practice, along with interaction and collaboration with local service providers. Currently, 65 community-based, feminist women’s health centres are providing services nationally, along with almost 400 refuges, shelters, safe houses and information and referral services for women escaping violence. Sexual assault services have been established in all States and Territories. Some are still independent and community based, others are government run, sometimes informed by feminist principles, sometimes with community representatives on their boards. There are approximately 150 community-controlled Aboriginal health centres, in which women play important roles. In addition, there are specialist centres, such as Children by Choice in Queensland, the Multicultural Centre for Women’s Health in Victoria and Aboriginal women’s health centres. Informed by a social perspective of health and illness, these organisations provide an extensive range of medical and non-medical services, tailored to respond to the expressed needs of the communities in which they are located. 306', '10 . A Glass Half Full... In women’s health centres, participation in health decision making is a daily reality. Clients are familiar with the concept of participation and they feel a sense of involvement with the centres they attend and a capacity to influence what happens there. Community women are often involved in centre management, and participation in the many group programs on offer opens the way for health development, empowerment, companionship, and the giving and receiving of support (Broom 1996:24–5, 1997:278). This is all the more valuable because women’s health centres serve a clientele that is markedly disadvantaged compared with the female population overall. Clients are significantly more likely to have been born overseas, to identify as being Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, to have lower education levels and below-average incomes, to have been unemployed in the past year, to be lone mothers and not to be buying their own homes (Broom 1997:277). These are the women who are least likely to participate in civil society and most likely to have poor health outcomes. Women’s health centres also undertake outreach work enabling them to make contact with women who might otherwise be excluded and whose needs often go unrecognised. Workers in women’s health centres are caring for women while at the same time assisting them to gain skills to care for themselves. And judging by the popularity of the centres, they are doing these jobs well. The number of women’s health advocacy groups continues to grow, supporting more women and drawing attention to an ever-broadening sweep of health issues. Professionals, including legal, law enforcement, allied health and medical professionals, have received training in feminist health perspectives and cultural competence. The latter now appears in the curriculums of some medical schools (Ambanpola 2005). Influenced by other social changes as well, the way women experience encounters with medical and hospital systems has shifted in response to the feminist critique. Professional attitudes are less patronising and judgmental and women’s health concerns are less likely to be trivialised. Finding a woman doctor, particularly a general practitioner, is likely to be easier, as women now enter medical training in much the same numbers as men. Raising public awareness of problems, such as the over-prescription of tranquillisers and the dangers of certain drugs, has resulted in increased health literacy and more careful practice. Following earlier overseas developments, moves are at last being initiated in Australia to ensure that appropriate numbers of women are included in research projects. The hundreds of refuges scattered across the country provide essential services for women and children, where previously there were almost none. Since the early days, when volunteers responded as best they could to the needs of the women and children landing on their doorsteps, feminist refuges have undertaken political advocacy as well as providing support services and crisis 307', 'Reaching for Health accommodation. As the expertise and professionalism of workers increased, the range of services was broadened and became increasingly sophisticated. Where budgets allow, refuges provide child care, children’s programs, child-protection services and programs to enhance parenting skills. They assist with legal and financial matters and with access to long-term housing. Counselling services are provided and families are assisted to deal with health issues. As well as advocacy and community education, refuges provide outreach and training. Staff regularly contribute to policy development and interact with a plethora of government and non-governmental agencies as part of efforts to coordinate complex sets of services (Gander and Champion 2009). Peak bodies, at both the sub-national and the national levels, support the sectors and act as a conduit to government.

It is a form of activism in which women have played significant roles at least since the eighteenth century. They continue to do so today. This chapter describes female leadership in the emergence and growth of the modern consumer movement, and in particular the health consumer movement. It is a sector in which women play many leading roles in different ways, according to their own preferences and values and to the circumstances in which leadership is needed. It is a sector that amply demonstrates the need for a broader understanding and reconceptualisation of leadership, as identified by Amanda Sinclair in this volume. The consumer movement has been largely neglected in the social movement and public policy literature, but in writing this chapter we have drawn on the small amount of literature available, interviews we conducted with 15 women leaders and our own experiences of working in and with consumer organisations.3 The consumer movement emerged from the failure of markets. Traditional economic theories assume that consumers are sovereign in the marketplace, that they will make rational choices based on full information and that perfect competition will prevail. In practice, producers (often large corporations) and providers of services have much greater political influence, economic resources and access to information. Some have abused this power through exploitative employment practices, unethical marketing or production of shoddy goods and services. Citizens have responded through individual and collective actions targeting a range of consumer products and services. The twentieth century saw the 1 Formerly Jane Elix Consulting and The Australian National University. Jane Elix conducted much of the research on the broad consumer movement. She and Kate Moore presented the original findings in a paper at the Women, Leadership and Democracy Conference in Canberra in December 2011. Later that month, Jane became seriously ill and was unable to complete the project. 2 The Australian National University. 3 Jane Elix was director of the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations from 1991 to 1993. Kate Moore was the executive director of the Consumers’ Health Forum of Australia from 1991 to 1999. She now represents the organisation on several committees. 313', 'Diversity in Leadership: Australian women, past and present formation of an organised consumer movement that ‘seeks to identify, expose and remedy incidences where manufacturers, retailers or service providers mislead, deceive or place consumers at risk of disadvantage’. It also lobbies governments to legislate for consumer protection and adequate regulatory standards for business and industry.4 Political consumerism Formally defined, political consumerism is the choice of producers and products with the aim of changing ethically or politically objectionable institutional or market practices.5 It is a form of activism that appears to be increasing. It also appears from the limited research in this area that women have a stronger preference for this form of participation than men.6 Even before women had the vote and significant access to independent financial means, boycotts mobilised the power and leadership of women. For example, in the late eighteenth century abolitionists in the United Kingdom organised a boycott of sugar produced using slave labour. They were primarily supported by female anti-slavery associations, which provided an early form of feisty female leadership.7 Notably, in 1824, Elizabeth Heyrick wrote a pamphlet entitled ‘Immediate, Not Gradual Abolition’. In it, she had the temerity to criticise the principal (male) anti-slavery campaigners, including William Wilberforce, as being overly cautious and slow in their dealings with the West Indian planters, saying they ‘have shown a great deal too much politeness and accommodation towards these gentlemen’. Her pamphlet sold thousands of copies and caused much discussion in various parts of England.8 In the early 1900s, Florence Kelly, leading the National Consumers League (NCL) in the United States, campaigned to use women’s purchasing power to improve conditions for working-class women, by granting its White Label to stores that met the NCL’s standards for minimum wages, maximum working hours and decent working conditions.9 4 Jane Brown, A History of the Australian Consumer Movement, ed.

Consuming interests Many early forms of political consumerism were directed at producers who used exploitative employment practices; later the role of protecting workers was increasingly assumed by trade unions, at least in developed countries. In the meantime, there were close links between political consumerists and unions. For example, in the 1930s Esther Petersen, a union organiser for textile sweatshop workers in the United States, developed close alliances with the women’s movement and the emerging consumer groups in order to gain better conditions for the women workers she represented.10 Political consumerism was a common form of political action throughout the twentieth century. Some campaigns targeted businesses in order to criticise governments—for example, boycotts by American business of French products, as a means of protesting about the French Government’s opposition to the US- led war in Iraq.11 In the 1970s and 1980s, boycotts of South African products and sporting events were successful in pressuring governments to stop support for the apartheid regime in that country. Other campaigns have been used directly to target the products of big companies including oil companies, and footwear and clothing manufacturers.12 The international boycott against the marketing by Nestlé of its baby-milk products in developing countries involved a number of women’s groups which had not previously been involved in political consumerism. Australian groups which participated included the Nursing Mothers Association, Parents’ Centres Australia and the Childbirth Education Association.13 Survey data published in 2005 show that political consumerism is on the rise and that a growing number of citizens are turning to the market to express their political and moral concerns.14 Recent advances in communications technologies such as email, Facebook and Twitter are enhancing the abilities of consumer activists to gain support for actions against producers who are seen to behave unethically. In Australia, the successful online campaign in 2012 to persuade companies to stop advertising on the Alan Jones 2UE radio program is but one recent example. Women were in the forefront of this campaign, which focused attention, in part, on misogynist behaviour.15 10 Eileen Baldry, ‘The Development of the Health Consumer Movement and its Effect on Value Changes and Health Policy in Australia’ (PhD thesis, University of New South Wales, Sydney, 1992), 62. 11 Remi Barroux, ‘Le Medef s’inquiete des consequences pour les entreprises des tensions franco- americaines’, Le Monde, 17 April 2003, quoted in Stolle et al., ‘Politics in the Supermarket’, 246. 12 Stolle et al., ‘Politics in the Supermarket’, 245–69. 13 Baldry, ‘The Development of the Health Consumer Movement’, 111. 14 Stolle et al., ‘Politics in the Supermarket’. 15 Larissa Nicholson, ‘Online and Outraged: The People Begin to Talk Back’, Sydney Morning Herald, 9 October 2012, http://www.smh.com.au/national/online-and-outraged-the-people-begin-to-talk-back- 20121008-279q8.html. 315', 'Diversity in Leadership: Australian women, past and present The modern consumer movement The modern consumer movement—described by Brown as ‘the intensification of organised consumer activity throughout Western developed nations from around 1960’16—developed alongside other movements that used political consumerism as part of their repertoire. These included anti-racist, feminist and environment movements in addition to self-help and support group movements. The earliest organised groups dealing specifically with consumer issues were formed in the first half of the twentieth century in the United States.17 As unions came to recognise themselves as representing consumers as well as workers, they joined forces with organisations of housewives during the Depression to challenge exorbitant prices for essential items and poor-quality products. With the growth of affluence in the mid 1930s, middle-class women and professional men demanded better quality control and some form of redress over badly made goods and dangerous products.18 This led to the formation of the modern consumer movement, characterised by a range of small and large groups campaigning for better products and services. The focus was initially on product testing and production of information for consumers. In the United States, the Consumers Union was formed in 1936, relying solely on membership subscriptions. It began testing products and publishing the reports of those tests, a model followed in 1957 by the Consumers Association in the United Kingdom and in 1959 by the Australian Consumers’ Association (ACA).

            "['5 Training the ‘natives’ as nurses in Australia: so what went wrong? Odette Best Introduction The story of the Aboriginal women who participated in Australia’s nursing history remains largely untold. In the first six decades of the twentieth century, Aboriginal people were confronted with harsh exclusionary practices that forced them to live in settlements, reserves and missions.1 While many Aboriginal women worked in domestic roles (in white people’s homes and on rural properties), small num- bers were trained at public hospitals and some Aboriginal women received training to be ‘native nurses’ who worked in hospitals on settlements In this chapter, an indigenous historical lens is applied to the status of Indigenous nurses and midwives in Australia. I explore the establishment of Australia’s nursing profession, and compare training of white nurses with training received by ‘native nurses’. I suggest that Australia failed to respond to the British Colonial Nursing Service’s agenda and argue that this failure, in part, contributed to the poor health status experienced by Indigenous Australians. I propose that four issues underpin the history of Indigenous nursing in Australia: the rise of social Darwinism, Australia’s Dominionship status, Acts of Parliament in Australia relevant to the lives of Indigenous people, and a lack of critical mass of Indigenous people. I provide three case studies from Queensland (Woorabinda, Cherbourg and Palm Island) of the early history of training Indigenous nurses in Australia. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people face the poorest health outcomes of any population group in Australia. At birth, the current life expectancy for Indigenous Australian men is 67.2 years, 11.5 years 104', 'Training the ‘natives’ as nurses in Australia less than the life expectancy of non-Indigenous men (78.7 years). For Indigenous women, the life expectancy at birth is 72.9 years, 9.7 years less than that of non-Indigenous women (82.6 years).2 Many complex factors underpin this life-expectancy gap. One important but com- monly overlooked factor is the number of Indigenous Australians working within the health system. Evidence suggests that improve- ments in Indigenous health are strongly linked to increased numbers of Indigenous people working in health service delivery.3 Throughout Australia’s history, there have been ongoing calls for increased numbers of Indigenous nurses and midwives.4 For example, as early as 1934 a Queensland parliamentarian, Mr Kenny, ‘criticised certain aspects of the aboriginal administration, and ... advocated the training of aboriginal nurses for aboriginal races’.5 Kenny was one of a small number of voices in Parliament who advocated for better Aboriginal health outcomes. Interestingly, he supported a protection- ist agenda by promoting ‘aboriginal nurses for aboriginal people’. In 1979, the Australian Aboriginal Health Report noted that: There are no Aboriginal doctors, few nurses and nurse trainees, and a lim- ited number of nurse aides. One important way of improving Aboriginal health is to have Aboriginals themselves filling these positions. It is there- fore necessary that as many Aboriginals as possible be trained in these pro- fessions in the shortest time possible.6 In 2011, Indigenous staff made up just 0.8 per cent of the nursing and midwifery workforce, even though Indigenous people accounted for 2.5 per cent of the total population. The 2011 Nursing and Midwifery Labour Force Survey identified that 2,212 of Australia’s nurses and midwives identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander, with 1,414 work- ing as registered nurses and 798 working as enrolled nurses. New South Wales had the highest number of Indigenous nurses, and less than one quarter (24.6 per cent) were employed in Queensland.7 Establishing nursing as a profession in Australia This history of nursing in Australia was influenced by changes in nurse education in Britain, largely led by Florence Nightingale. Strachan suggests that, prior to the 1860s, nursing in Australia was regarded as a lowly occupation and was mostly undertaken by untrained men and 105', 'Odette Best women who worked in institutions. Between 1860 and 1890, training emerged as a necessary prerequisite for the role, and nursing became almost exclusively an occupation for women of education.8 In 1863, the widow of the New South Wales Chief Justice wrote to Nightingale, asking her to send trained nurses to Australia. The plea initially fell on deaf ears but, in 1864, doctors in Sydney requested that the Board of the Sydney Infirmary employ a small number of trained sisters from the Council of the Nightingale Fund. They argued that the ‘doctors at the Sydney Infirmary were sure that nurses were the key to any effective cure’.9 In 1868, six nurses who had been trained and appointed by Florence Nightingale arrived in Sydney to ‘take charge of nursing’ in the colony. They worked under the leadership of Lucy Osburn. In 1871, one of the original six nurses, Sister Annie Miller, was appointed as matron of Brisbane Hospital. By 1886, the Brisbane Children’s Hospital was awarding certificates to white nurses of European extraction who had completed formal training there and achieved a standard of competency.10 In the late 1890s, nursing was increasingly professionalised in Australia. Hospitals became training centres for nurses. In 1899, the Australasian Trained Nurses Association (ATNA) was formed. It committed to four main aims: 1. promoting the interests of trained nurses in all matters affecting their work as a class; 2. establishing a system of registration for trained nurses; 3. affording opportunities for discussing subjects bearing on the work of nurses; 4. initiating and controlling schemes that would afford nurses a means of provid- ing an allowance during incapacity for work caused by sickness, accident, age or other necessitous circumstances.11 ATNA was a voluntary association that was founded in Sydney by concerned nurses and medical practitioners. As a voluntary body, it had no legal powers to enforce the standards it promoted. During the first half of the twentieth century, ATNA worked to professionalise nursing and delineate the standards relevant for a trained nurse.12 The early history of nursing in Australia shows little acknowledgement that Indigenous Australians might be involved in the delivery of healthcare and be trained as health workers. Indigenous nurses and midwives are notable only by their absence. Prior to invasion, Aboriginal and Torres 106', 'Training the ‘natives’ as nurses in Australia Strait Islander people practised their own approach to medicine and healthcare. Health knowledge was passed down from generation to generation through a strong and successful oral tradition. Medicines and health resources were based on what was locally available. For Aboriginal people, hospitals with a professional staff of nurses and doctors made no sense. In addition, the Western approach of treating illness did not fit with the understanding of holistic healthcare. Before her nurses were sent to Australia, Florence Nightingale con- ducted research about the health of Aboriginal Australians. Her inter- est in Indigenous health was established during a meeting with Sir George Grey, ‘who had discussed with her the apparent deterioration and gradual disappearance of native races after contact with white civilisation’.13 Nightingale applied to the Colonial Office for funds to carry out research ‘to ascertain, if possible the precise influence which school training exercised on the health of native children’.14 She was successful in receiving funding, and devised a ‘simple school form’ to send to the native schools of the colonies. She received responses from Western Australia and South Australia, and presented her research in York (UK) in 1864.15 The responses that Nightingale received from Australia were highly racist and showed gross ignorance. Aboriginal people were described as ‘savages’, ‘uncivilised’ and in urgent need of being brought into civi- lisation. In the mid-1800s, when Nightingale conducted her research, ‘civilising’ Aboriginal people involved conversion to Christian beliefs. Aboriginal spirituality was not acknowledged, and people’s spiri- tual beliefs were not regarded as an essential part of their health and identity. Within Nightingale’s writings, there is no acknowledgement of the efficacy of Aboriginal traditional medicines. Only one person who responded to Nightingale hinted at the value of traditional medi- cines: Bishop Salvadore noted: A native belonging to the institution became ill with spitting of blood; a sure mark of fatal disease, if the patient is treated in the usual way. The patient begged to be allowed to go into the bush; and after days hunting of horses, he returned sufficiently recovered to resume his occupations.16 This is obviously a direct quotation from Bishop Salavadore: ‘hunt- ing horses’ in colonial periods was largely undertaken by indigenous 107', 'Odette Best men. The meat and the leather of horses was heavily utilised and also provided some sort of income for Indigenous men, as horses could be sold for both their meat and hides (for leather). It also meant for the men that they could continue traditional hunting activities to hone the skills required to hunt. It also meant access- ing traditional food sources and not the introduced food sources which were prevalent on the reserves and missions and had little nutritional value in comparison with traditional diets – it is possi- ble that the combination of traditional medicine, exercise and diet was responsible for his recovery. During the period of early nurse education and the establishment of hospitals as training sites, the wives of white settlers wrote about the value of Aboriginal birthing practices. For example, an elderly ‘Dame Mary Gilmore in the 1930’s recollected that Aboriginal women were preferred to\n",

            "['Chapter 1 Medicine and a Message Public health reformers had every reason for optimism at the dawn of the 1920s. Two seminal events had set grand plans in motion. The first, the decision of the American Red Cross (ARC) that its newly reconfigured peace- time mis- sion would concentrate on the more effective organization of health and social services through neighborhood health centers, promised to solve the knotty problem of care coordination among the myriad of public and private entities operating in large urban areas like New York City. The second, the release of data from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company’s intensive tuberculosis (TB) case finding and treating study in Framingham, Massachusetts, suggested a direct path to bring the “white plague” under control at last. Yet, New York City’s leading public health nurses looked askance at the developing plans to establish the city’s own health center and to eradicate tuberculosis— at least as it involved them. They believed they had already solved their discipline’s organizational issues with a private system that brought bedside nursing and health teaching to the individual homes of the sick poor and a public system that provided broader communities with health education, immunizations, communicable disease control and quarantines, and the oversight of the health of school- aged children. The city’s Henry Street Settlement and Visiting Nurse Service (VNS) was world-r enowned for its ability to bring “medicine and a message” of health and American values into the homes of working- class and immigrant families. Its Department of Health, under the tutelage of Lillian Wald, the founder of Henry Street, had the first and now had the largest numbers of nurses working with children in the city’s schools.1 13', '14 Nursing with a Message This chapter maps the social, political, and public health landscape of New York City as it planned to meet these challenges in the aftermath of the First World War. It explores how a small group of white, middle-c lass, and well-e ducated public health nursing leaders worked among themselves and with other reformers to consolidate the disciplinary power they gained in their effective work bringing “medicine and a message” of American values to the working, poor, and often immigrant families they served prior to the war. It situates these women within the compromise brokered between public health and private medicine. Bruising battles between public health reformers and representatives of medical practitioners had established firm boundaries regarding who should treat the poor. Those nurses working in public agencies in large urban areas could only teach mothers and children about health and only rarely provided actual home bedside nursing care. In New York City, those working for private agencies like the VNS, the Association for Improving the Conditions of the Poor (AICP), and the Maternity Center Association (MCA) had more latitude. They provided bedside nursing care to sick individuals and prenatal care to mothers even as they taught their families the principles of health and hygiene. They also had a history of strong financial support from the Rockefeller Foundation. Yet, like their colleagues in other large urban cities, these nurses worked within a complicated matrix that also supported the work of hundreds of other public health nurses employed by small, private neighborhood settlement houses, churches, welfare associations, and community organizations in the city. The proliferation of such agencies across the United States drove the national postwar emphasis on care coordination as a central element of the ARC’s com- mitment to health demonstration projects. In New York City, the problem of so many clinicians working to solve the same kinds of problems brought together the same prominent male social workers and sympathetic physicians to consult with the Rockefeller Foundation and the Milbank Memorial Fund. They suc- cessfully found Foundation funding to create a community- based health center in the East Harlem neighborhood of the city that could more efficiently coordi- nate the delivery of health and social welfare services to those in need; and they dreamed with the Fund’s officers of constructing a “monumental enterprise” in the Bellevue-Y orkville districts of the city that would eradicate TB, compel the attention of “scientific men,” and force action among communities of voters that seemed far too complacent about the need to increase tax dollars to pay for public healthcare. The city’s leading public health nurses were not invited to these philan- thropic tables, although they were aware of the plans. On the one hand, this', 'Medicine and a Message 15 omission reeked of the privilege of alliances among powerful white men who were comfortable in viewing public health nurses as the veritable foot soldiers of their reform army. But it also kept at a distance those who were not engaged in their vision. Lillian Wald, the most powerful nursing leader in the city, if not the world, wanted no part of any planned demonstration either at East Harlem or Bellevue-Y orkville. East Harlem seemed particularly troubling. In addition to demonstrating the value of health and social welfare, the second demon- stration that involved nurses would be one of care control. The East Harlem Nursing and Health Demonstration Project intended to pool all neighborhood nursing personnel and financial resources into one centralized organization to reduce nursing redundancies and clinical overlaps. Wald and her public health nursing colleagues centered at the VNS felt quite comfortable ignoring the plans of other public health reformers. They believed themselves to be very secure in the putative empire they had built in New York City, an empire created by well- educated nurses adhering to the high- est public health nursing standards when nursing the sick poor in their homes. But they were well aware that their nurses were an anomaly, not the norm. Wald and her colleagues were preoccupied with issues surrounding the education for practice of all public health nurses, not public health practice itself. Planning for Nursing Both contemporaries and historians recognized New York City’s place at the epicenter of the public health world in the aftermath of the First World War. Under the prewar leadership of Hermann M. Biggs, the city attracted inter- national attention for its school health, immunization, tuberculosis, scientific laboratories, and clean milk reform initiatives. They also recognized the city’s place at the epicenter of the nursing world. Service institutions such as the VNS at Henry Street and educational initiatives such as those at Teachers Col- lege at Columbia University attracted and trained public health nursing leaders from around the globe.2 But for all its successes, postwar New York City still faced seemingly intractable health issues among its poor, working-c lass, and immigrant families—t hose most vulnerable to the rising costs of living in the postwar city, labor strikes, and, as the Department of Health reported, the “unstable eco- nomic conditions.”3 These health issues included high infant mortality rates, poor prenatal care, and insufficient attention to the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis. Established philanthropies, such as the venerable AICP, the largest and most influential private social service organization in New York City, provided important financial and social welfare assistance to the city’s', '16 Nursing with a Message own public health initiatives, particularly for families that included a member with tuberculosis. All New York City public health leaders clearly understood the relationships among the conditions in which families lived, the material resources available to them, the access to education available to their children, and their health status. But issues of access and equity to the essential social and health services necessary to allow mothers to raise healthy infants, to help children achieve in school, and to enable breadwinners to remain productive at work remained highly problematic.4 The city’s nursing leadership, joined by other public health reformers, believed they had another, more vexing, problem to solve in the early 1920s: how would middle- class families who needed care be nursed? In New York City, as in other parts of the country, the working and immigrant poor had access to the services of privately funded visiting nurse services who sent skilled nurses into their homes for short, often daily visits and charged fees that were heav- ily subsidized by donors. The rich had access to private-d uty nurses, graduates of hospital- based training schools, who stayed by their patients’ bedsides for the entire illness experience and charged concomitantly higher fees that were beyond the reach of most middle- class Americans. As one commentator noted in 1921, “the great problem” is “the problem of providing adequate nursing service for the community at a rate within the means of those who must pay for such services.”5 Ideas for solving this problem abounded: Have visiting nurse societ- ies engage in the “hourly nursing” of middle-c lass families at rates greater than those charged the poor but less than the cost of continuous private-d uty nursing; have nursing registries— employment agencies that matched a family in need of service with a private- duty nurse in need of work— seek opportunities for nurses who wanted less than continuous employment at prorated fees less than that usually charged; and, to the chagrin of nursing leaders, create a new category of a subsidiary nurse or nurse attendant who had a much shorter period of training.6 But in New York City there was cause for some optimism. Nurses Annie Goodrich, who had become head of Henry Street, and Anne Stevens of the Maternity Center Association proposed yet another alternative. They turned to two allies and strong\n",

            "['Introduction Once upon a time, before the feminists carried their banners emblazoned with the women’s sign and the inscription ‘Women’s Liberation’, there was a luxury tax on the contraceptive pill. (Stevens 1995:13) When the women’s health movement burst onto the Australian political scene as part of the resurgent women’s movement, resentment about social arrangements was intense. Women knew how it felt to be trivialised, disbelieved and dismissed. They had experienced frustration, indignity and stigmatisation in their daily lives. For many, encounters with the health system were unsatisfactory and often humiliating and traumatising. In the early 1970s, the gatherings organised by mobilising feminists provided an opportunity for women to ventilate their concerns, often for the first time. The gender order would never be quite the same again. At a packed public ‘speak-out’ organised by Melbourne feminists in early 1973, poor health care and lack of relevant information emerged as the dominant concerns. Women told stories that shocked those listening, stories that were confirmed by the doctors, nurses and healthcare workers who were present. Women’s health care was condemned as too often ‘demeaning, discriminatory, judgemental and of poor quality’ (Hull 1986:14). Sydney women reached a similar verdict at another gathering a few weeks later. Unmarried women told of lectures that implied immorality and promiscuity when they requested contraceptives, which were often denied them, and married women talked about the difficulties and the humiliation of requesting an abortion. Older women reported being unable to get information about menopause and of being summarily dismissed or referred to a psychiatrist. All women shared the distress they felt at being made to feel ‘dirty, shameful, unbalanced, neurotic, stupid and guilty’. Out of these meetings, the first dedicated women’s health groups were formed. The intention was to set up centres where skilled medical care would be available, where women could speak openly about their lives and share their experiences ‘in an atmosphere of warmth, acceptance and understanding’ (Cooper and Spencer 1978:149). Feminists, as well as feeling anger about their encounters with the health system, objected strongly to the entrenched gender order. From the ‘best’ clubs to local pubs, women were frequently excluded from sporting and social venues. The bar obliging married women to resign from permanent jobs in the Public Service had been lifted in 1966 but women were still largely absent from public- sector life. Domestic violence, rape and child sexual abuse were not discussed openly. A feminist-produced sex education pamphlet for young women was branded ‘obscene’ by major newspapers in 1971 and abortion-squad detectives 1', 'Reaching for Health carried out investigations at Sydney girls’ schools, even though the brochure had been approved by parents’ and citizens’ associations (Stevens 1995:14–15). Sanitary pads were wrapped in brown paper and hidden under pharmacy counters and women’s sexuality was still depicted in Australian obstetrical and gynaecological textbooks from a heterosexual perspective with women’s natural aspirations portrayed as marriage and mothering (Koutroulis 1990). There were few publicly funded support services for women or anyone else who needed them. After more than 20 years of conservative national government, the Australian welfare system was in a primordial state, having missed out on most of the expansion that had taken place in comparable countries after World War II (Gray 2003; Jones 1990:29–48). The hospital and medical system was sorely in need of reform; financial barriers to access were high and the range of services was narrow (Gray 1984, 1991; Sax 1984). Aboriginal communities and Aboriginal health were ravaged by the combined impacts of colonisation, racism and government policies. Despite high immigration rates in the 1950s and 1960s, services for newly arrived people were scarce. It was extremely difficult to find an interpreter, for example, even in the largest hospitals in the country. There was no public income support for single parents, and about 80 per cent of court orders for family maintenance were never honoured. Only the wealthy could afford child care. Some lone mothers, who needed paid work to survive, took small children with them to early morning cleaning jobs. Others left them at home to take themselves to school, sometimes hours before the starting bell. It was in this context that the embryonic women’s health movement made its first faltering efforts to respond to the calls for help that were being made. As one participant remembers the early situation: ‘the phone calls and letters were coming in from women everywhere...They desperately needed information on abortion, contraception, and many other things that were affecting their health so badly. And we didn’t know the answers!’ (Zelda D’Aprano, quoted in Robertson n.d.:Ch. 16). With few resources and, in many cases, very little knowledge about politics or medical care, small groups of women set out not only to provide health services but also to achieve fundamental social change and public policy transformation. From the beginning, they knew that many of the circumstances of women’s lives, not least their second-class status, had a detrimental impact on their health and needed to be changed. They articulated the problems arising from gender roles, identified domestic violence as a serious women’s health issue and broke the silence surrounding sexual assault. Where they found glaring gaps in the services available they tried to fill them by establishing services themselves: health centres, sexual assault services and refuges for women and children who had nowhere to go were set up on precarious foundations. They set up telephone help lines to provide information and support. They took to the streets to fight 2', 'Introduction for a woman’s right to choose a safe abortion and they campaigned on factory floors and within the union movement to modernise occupational health and safety regimes. Mothers’ groups agitated for women’s control of childbirth and to achieve maternity-care reform. Feminist-inspired training modules for the police, the judiciary and other relevant professions were developed, so that sexual assault and violence services might be delivered more appropriately. Healthcare providers were trained and educated about feminist health perspectives. The underlying philosophy was to provide services and support ‘by women, for women’. Critiques of the social, political and economic organisation of society were developed, along with strategies for how to promote change. In carrying out this work, women faced huge obstacles, particularly a shortage of resources of all kinds. As time went on, it became increasingly clear that the structural forces supporting the existing system were not going to be dislodged easily. In health, the power of organised medicine was brought to bear against every reform proposal, while pharmaceutical giants continued to peddle their wares. Bureaucracies—not accustomed to being challenged and comfortable with longstanding structures and practices—resisted new ideas, especially the notion that there should be separate women’s services. In the cultural sphere, ideas proved to be durable, especially discourses around domestic violence and rape. And when women suggested changes that would improve their economic position, the power of business and its acolytes mobilised against them. Whether it was community- based child care, national superannuation or paid maternity leave, the arguments against were that markets do a better job and are cheaper for the public purse. The political environment of the very early years was, however, a rare moment—one that was unusually favourable for the articulation of radical change proposals. Radical Reform on the Radar: The context of the early women’s health movement In public policy terms, the context in which proposals are developed has a strong impact on outcomes. Some political contexts facilitate change while others retard it. The environment in which the Australian women’s health movement emerged presented perhaps a ‘once in a lifetime’ policy opportunity. Internationally, change was in the air as radical challenges to the status quo were mounted in all Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. Equality-seeking social movements—interested in such issues as civil rights, 3', 'Reaching for Health peace, sexuality, the environment, self-help, and consumer, student, worker and women’s issues—were generating proposals for root-and-branch reform of existing power relations. In Australia, the health system was highly controversial. The publicly subsidised private health insurance system was inequitable, unpopular, complicated and expensive. Approximately 20 per cent of Australians had no health insurance coverage and hundreds of thousands had inadequate coverage. Frustration was widespread because the Liberal Coalition Government1—in power for more than 20 years—had failed to countenance reform except within the parameters of a private insurance regime. Competition between the major parties was intense as the Australian Labor Party (ALP), in opposition, developed a series of reform proposals that generated fierce public debates. Inside the ALP, opinions were divided between those who supported traditional Labor approaches to health, including a national, community-based medical service, staffed by salaried doctors, and those who supported the newer idea of universal health insurance. The former group opposed the entrenchment of the private fee-for-service medical practice that would come with national insurance because they thought it inimical to good health care. Many within the party, therefore, viewed health insurance as a transitional measure, a step along the way to a comprehensive \n",

            "['CHAPTER FOUR Avoiding Adverse Drug Events Through Computerized Physician Order Entry James H. Bigelow, Ph.D., and Constance Fung, M.D. Introduction Evidence suggests that Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE) can improve patient safety in both hospital and ambulatory environments (Bates, Leape et al., 1998; Bates, Teich et al., 1999; Johnston et al., 2003, 2004; Leape et al., 1995, 2000; Overhage, Tierney, and Zhou, 1997). Unsurprisingly, then, interest in CPOE increased greatly when the Institute of Medicine (IOM) (Corrigan and Donaldson, eds., 1999) reported that between 44,000 and 98,000 people die from medical errors in U.S. hospitals each year. The Leapfrog Group1 has made installing CPOE in hospitals one of its recommendations (Birkmeyer et al., 2000, 2001). One measure of patient safety is the incidence of adverse drug events (ADEs). These are injuries resulting in a medical intervention related to a drug (Bates et al., 1995). In this chapter, we describe how we estimated the effects of using CPOE in hospitals and physician practices nationwide to avoid both inpatient and ambulatory ADEs. In addition, we were able to estimate some benefits of ambulatory CPOE that are not related to ADE avoidance. Computerized Physician Order Entry When a hospital or a physician’s practice implements CPOE, physicians stop writing orders by hand on pieces of paper and start entering them electronically into a com- puter system. But much more than order-writing is going on. First, the CPOE makes information available to the physician at the time he or she enters the order. If the ____________ 1 The Leapfrog Group is an initiative driven by organizations that buy health care who are working to initiate breakthrough improvements in the safety, quality and affordability of healthcare for Americans. It is a voluntary program aimed at mobilizing employer purchasing power to alert America’s health industry that big leaps in health care safety, quality and customer value will be recognized and rewarded. Quote from http://www.leapfroggroup.org (as of February 17, 2005). 47', '48 Analysis of Healthcare Interventions That Change Patient Trajectories physician is writing a medication order, for example, the CPOE may present a list of drugs that the patient is already taking and warn of any interactions those drugs may have with the drug being ordered. The CPOE may display the patient’s most recent laboratory results. It can check the dose against dosage standards. Once the order has been entered, the system can track the steps involved in executing the order,2 pro- viding a mechanism for identifying and eliminating errors. In the longer term, it pro- vides the information needed to redesign the order-execution process so that making errors becomes much more difficult. To provide these benefits, the CPOE must include decision support and it must have access to current patient-specific information—in effect, an Electronic Medical Record (EMR). Thus, when we speak of CPOE, we mean the capability of a more comprehensive health information system. Implementing such a clinical information system is not merely an information technology (IT) project. It is an organizational-change initiative. As suggested by the comments above on order-execution tracking, the organization should anticipate that processes will have to change to take advantage of CPOE’s potential. However, these changes can take place mostly within existing organizations. If a hospital installs CPOE, the value of CPOE can be realized by changing processes (such as the medi- cation-administration process) within the hospital. It is not necessary that activities in the hospital be any better coordinated with activities at physicians’ offices than they are now. Adverse Drug Events Bates et al. (1995) suggest what has become standard terminology for discussing ad- verse drug events: • Adverse drug events are injuries resulting from medical interventions related to a drug. • Adverse drug reaction is a synonym for adverse drug event. • Medication errors are errors in the process of ordering or delivering a medication, regardless of whether an injury occurred or the potential for injury was present. • Potential ADEs are medication errors judged to have the potential for injury but in which no injury occurred. • Serious medication errors are medication errors associated with ADEs and poten- tial ADEs. ____________ 2 Currently, hospital CPOE systems are more likely than ambulatory systems to track execution, because executing in the hospital is the job of hospital staff. In the ambulatory setting, executing a medication order is the responsibility of the patient. Considering how many prescriptions go unfilled, and how many discrepancies there are between what the doctor prescribes and what the ambulatory patient actually does (Bedell et al., 2000), tracking would probably be a good idea in the ambulatory setting, as well.', 'Avoiding Adverse Drug Events Through CPOE 49 Only a small fraction of medication errors is serious. Bates, Miller et al. (1999) report that in three medical units at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, during four periods totaling 220 days in 1992–1997, a total of 2,363 medication errors occurred, of which 253 were deemed serious. Of the 253 serious medication errors, 216 were intercepted, meaning that they were corrected before the medication was administered to the patient. This left 37 nonintercepted serious medication errors, or about 1.5 percent of the total medication errors. ADEs and medication errors are related, since some medication errors result in ADEs. But either can occur without the other. For example, if a patient has an aller- gic reaction to a drug and there is no record of his sensitivity, there has been an ADE but no error. Conversely, if a patient receives the wrong drug or the wrong dose but no injury results, there has been an error but no ADE. CPOE reduces ADEs by re- ducing medication errors. However, ADEs that are not the result of any error will occur despite the presence of CPOE. The Inpatient Setting We used the process shown in Figure 4.1 to estimate the effects of inpatient CPOE for the nation as a whole. Our data sources are listed across the top of the figure. Opportunity and Frailty Scores In our model, we assumed an overall rate for serious medication errors and for ADEs, and we needed to devise a way to distribute them among hospital inpatients having different characteristics. When Bates, Teich et al. (1999) attempted to identify patient risk factors for ADEs, he concluded that [a]dverse drug events occurred more frequently in sicker patients who stayed in the hospital longer. However, after controlling for level of care and pre-event length of stay, few risk factors emerged. To capture the “sicker-patient” effect, we summarized the 1999 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data to generate a list of patients grouped by diagnosis. A physician assigned opportunity and frailty scores based on these diagnoses. We intended the opportunity score for a diagnosis to reflect the relative likelihood that a hospital would make a serious medication error for a patient with that diagnosis. Each score could have values low, medium, or high.', '50 Analysis of Healthcare Interventions That Change Patient Trajectories Figure 4.1 Process for Estimating Effects of Using CPOE to Reduce ADEs HCUP, 2000 MEPS, 1999 AHA, 2000 Medical error Select National Inpatient Hospital and ADE rates hospitals Inpatient File Survey from literature for CPOE Sample Summarize Patients Merge Analysis grouped by in hospital Dataset Summarize diagnoses characteristics (Hosp_ADE.xls) Groups rated by physician Consequences of implementing CPOE in selected hospitals Opportunity Merge in Discharges by • ADEs avoided and frailty ratings and hospital and ratings by • Bed-days saved summarize two ratings group • Dollars saved RAND MG408-4.1 In general, high ratings were given to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), coagulation disorders, and renal failure. Medium or high ratings were given to cancers, pneumonia, cardiac disorders, diabetes, and liver disorders. We intended the frailty score to reflect the relative likelihood that the error would generate an ADE. Each score could have values low, medium, or high. High frailty ratings were given to liver and kidney disorders, and to acute myocardial infarctions (AMIs). Psychiatric diagnoses and eye-related diagnoses received low ratings. We distributed errors and ADEs only to patients with high scores. To capture the length-of-stay effect, we distributed errors and ADEs to high-scoring patients in proportion to patient-days (rather than to admissions). In the end, however, we combined the two scores by taking the minimum. That is, both the opportunity and frailty scores had to be high for the diagnosis to receive an overall high score. The Excel file MERADE.xls (available at http://www.rand.org/publications/MG/MG408, and also on the compact disc (CD) included with printed copies of this monograph) shows the ratings we gave to various diagnoses and (in some cases) combinations of diagnoses. The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) We merged the opportunity and frailty scores into NIS_2000_10PCT_SAMPLE_A, a public-use file available from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s', 'Avoiding Adverse Drug Events Through CPOE 51 (AHRQ’s) Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (AHRQ NIS, 2000).

INTRODUCTION In 2000, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) published To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System, which brought the problem of medical errors to the attention of the healthcare community, as well as the general public, by showing that preventable adverse medical events resulting from human error pose a significant threat to patient safety and cost the healthcare industry over ten billion dollars annually. The issue has remained high on the nation’s healthcare agenda. On July 29, 2005, after being passed by overwhelming majorities in both houses of Congress, the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 (Public Law [P.L.] 109-41) was signed into law by the president, thereby establishing a national system for the voluntary reporting of medical errors. Under this law, hospitals and other healthcare providers will be encouraged to confidentially report information on medical errors to patient safety organizations (PSOs), entities that will be certified as meeting the criteria set forth in the law by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). The PSOs are to be placed on a publicly available list to be maintained by HHS. PSOs will analyze the information on medical errors that is reported to them and will give feedback to the healthcare providers about the possible causes of the medical errors that are reported, which will help to identify and implement possible ways to prevent those errors from happening again without fear of any of the supplied information becoming part of a lawsuit. The PSOs will then forward selected details about these medical errors to a network of databases, the creation of which will be facilitated by HHS, to give healthcare providers and others throughout the nation an “interactive evidence-based management resource” to use to conduct analyses as well as reduce medical errors and promote patient safety. Early reactions to the new law, reported in the Washington Post (Gaul, 2005, p. A06), were mixed. One consumer advocate referred to it as “a teeny step forward.” Jill Rosenthal, an analyst with the', '- 2 - National Academy for State Health Policy (NASHP), raised practical questions about how the new law would affect healthcare organizations in states that are already monitoring patient safety. In particular, she noted that the existence of dual reporting systems could create uncertainty about requirements for reporting to both the patient safety organization and the state and about how the two reporting systems might work together. Robert Wachter, a professor of medicine and chair of the patient safety committee at the Medical Center of the University of California, San Francisco, observed that the new law, although symbolically important, would likely have little practical effect. Apparently referring to the variation across the states on how adverse medical events are currently defined and reported to state systems—circumstances that the new law will not change, Wachter described the present situation as “a chaotic mess” (Gaul, 2005, p. A6). One reason for the difficulties Wachter described is a “disconnect” between the characteristics of traditional state-level mandatory adverse event reporting systems and the key characteristics of the patient safety reporting systems advocated in IOM (2000). Traditional systems that predate the IOM report were designed to hold hospitals accountable for the most serious mistakes made in the provision of healthcare. Facilities were required to notify state authorities whenever adverse events occurred—however adverse events were defined. Generally, the state would then follow up to ensure that some combination of on-site incident investigation and appropriate institutional response occurred. In such systems, the state agency could, potentially, impose fees and sanctions or suspend or revoke a facility’s license for failure to report such an event (Rosenthal et al., 2001), but efforts to identify systemic problems that might give rise to efforts to prevent similar problems in the future were rare. In contrast, patient safety reporting systems of the sort described in IOM (2000) are similar to risk management systems, which are institutional activities that healthcare organizations—particularly hospitals—undertake to prevent real or potential threats of financial loss due to an accident, injury, or medical malpractice (Kraman and', '- 3 - Hamm, 1999). Risk management systems involve detailed assessments, including root cause analyses (RCAs), of adverse events. Modern patient safety reporting systems are similar to risk management systems in terms of what constitutes an adverse event and, in some states, in the requirements for detailed analyses of the circumstances surrounding the event. But the two kinds of systems have very different goals; whereas the purpose of risk management systems is to reduce human, facility, and financial risks associated with the operations of an institution, the objective of patient safety systems is generally to improve the overall quality of healthcare. In keeping with the recommendations presented in IOM (2000), the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) is leading the national Patient Safety Initiative to combat medical errors and to improve patient safety. As part of this initiative, states are encouraged to set up reporting systems that require healthcare organizations to report to the states information that has traditionally been required only at the institutional level (through risk management systems). Examples of such information include RCA and risk assessment indices. Other key characteristics of patient safety reporting systems cited by patient safety experts include, in addition to confidentiality, are that they are voluntary (although some experts believe that reporting of the most serious adverse events should be mandatory), nonpunitive and undiscoverable in legal proceedings, timely and responsive, and easy to use (IOM, 2000; Cohen, 2000; Leape, 2002). In response, many states have sought to retrofit existing reporting systems so that they focus more explicitly on patient safety reporting. Other states that lacked reporting systems have recently implemented systems that are more similar to the patient safety systems recommended by IOM, while still other states have retained their original reporting systems. In this report, we describe these diverse reporting systems. In particular, we focus on determining how the various state reporting systems differ in the kinds of information about adverse events included in event reports, a perspective that differentiates this analysis from previous studies of adverse event reporting systems. We focus on state- level adverse event reporting systems that cover hospitals, but,', '- 4 - depending on the characteristics of the state system in question, also include other facilities (e.g., long-term care facilities). The results of this analysis are intended to inform the development of a national patient safety repository that aggregates data from states and other disparate entities (Farley et al., 2005). In particular, the results in this report can be used to determine whether a core set of adverse events that states could incorporate into their systems should be established and, if so, what that core set of elements might be. We note that, presently, the federal government does not require states to adopt specific reporting standards, and we do not take a position on whether national standards should be adopted. But, even without national standards, institutional or state-level efforts to improve patient safety may profit from the experience of other institutions and states, and such cross-jurisdiction comparisons are most likely to be fruitful if they rely on similar reporting standards. Standardization of adverse medical event reporting systems across states has potential benefits for state and federal policymakers, providers, and researchers. Access to a standard set of information about the occurrence of adverse events in other states would permit state policymakers to compare the performance of their own states with that of other states; for smaller states in which adverse medical events are rare, the availability of such a dataset would permit more statistically valid analyses of trends. For state and federal policymakers and researchers, standardization would enable a comparison of patterns of events across institutions to determine which adverse events are rare and which are frequent, and what circumstances are associated with the occurrence of particular events. Standardization of event reporting would also permit analysts to identify trends in adverse events across healthcare systems and to monitor improvements in patient safety associated with specific interventions, such as those implemented as part of the AHRQ Patient Safety Initiative.', '- 5 - The need for standardization is expressed in a number of NASHP2 publications describing event-reporting activities under way at the state level (Flowers and Riley, 2000; Flowers and Riley, 2001; Riley, 2000; Rosenthal, Riley, and Booth, 2000; Rosenthal and Riley, 2001; Rosenthal et al., 2001). One theme running through these reports is the absence of federal guidance in the standardization of adverse event reporting systems, including definitions of adverse events and systems for categorizing—or coding—those events. OVERVIEW OF THIS REPORT As we have noted, state-level adverse medical event reporting systems, as they exist currently, vary from state to state and in the kind of information reported about events. In this report, we characterize the variations across states in the kinds of adverse events reported and in the information reported about those events; we also discuss the utility of existing healthcare standards for coding adverse event data. In addition, we conclude with an action plan to implement a standardized system for reporting data on adverse medica\n",

Background and Description of the Demonstration and Its Evaluation Increasing use of advanced medical imaging is often cited as a key driver of medical spending growth, including a fourfold increase in Medicare program spending between 1995 and 2005. Although recent trends show a decline in utilization rates for advanced imaging, several studies have found that many imaging requests are inappropriate, risking harm to patients through radiation exposure and increasing health care costs. Inappropriate medical imaging also imposes other, less commonly considered risks, including downstream tests and procedures resulting from misdiagnosis or from findings that are otherwise benign. These downstream effects have little value at best, and can be harmful at worst. Several approaches have been implemented or recommended to curb the use of inappropriate imaging procedures. One approach uses computer tools known as decision support systems (DSSs) that provide physicians and patients with feedback on the appropriateness of treatment options being considered during patient encounters. DSS tools synthesize existing evidence on the effectiveness of each procedure, including appropriateness criteria developed by physician specialty societies, so physicians can base decisions on the current evidence at the point of care. Despite evidence of potential effectiveness, current adoption and use of DSSs are limited. Beginning in January 2011, the Medicare Imaging Demonstration (MID) tested a specific type of DSS on a large scale to provide insight into the challenges and opportunities for deploying DSSs in Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) settings, an area identified with high rates of inappropriate use. The design was expected to permit examination of appropriateness of advanced imaging orders across geographic areas, specialties, and practice settings for Medicare FFS patients. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) contracted with five “conveners” that aggregated participating practices and served as the point of contact for implementation of the demonstration. Twelve advanced imaging procedures were selected for the demonstration on the basis of (1) a high volume of orders; (2) availability of clinical appropriateness criteria developed or endorsed by a medical specialty society; and (3) variation in utilization rates between urban and rural geographic areas and states. The overall goal of this project is to evaluate the MID to assess rates of physician ordering of advanced diagnostic imaging services, whether the DSS tool is a viable option for exposing physicians to professional guidelines when ordering advanced imaging, and how, if at all, DSS exposure is associated with changes in the use of advanced imaging. Based on these analyses, we also provide recommendations for the consideration of policymakers. In the remainder of this introduction, we provide a review of the literature on advanced imaging utilization; then describe the MID in more detail, including the general approach and requirements for the demonstration; and finally, we describe the structure of this report. 3', '1.1 Literature Review 1.1.A. Growth and Decline in Utilization Sizable growth in utilization of advanced imaging during the early 2000s elevated image volumes to historic highs. From 2000 to 2006, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and nuclear medicine utilization for Medicare FFS beneficiaries grew across all major places of service. Private offices reported compound annual growth rates of 17.5 percent, 14.9 percent, and 18.4 percent, respectively, for CT, MRI, and nuclear medicine. Hospital outpatient departments saw growth as well, albeit with less intensity. During this period, the volume of CT, MRI, and nuclear medicine procedures conducted in hospital outpatient settings increased by 8.6 percent, 11.3 percent, and 4.2 percent, respectively (Levin, Rao, and Parker, 2012). Recent evidence suggests that the growth in utilization of advanced imaging decelerated around 2006. Where advanced imaging annual growth was 13.7 percent from 2000 to 2006, there was an annual decline of 4.5 percent in spending for advanced imaging from 2006 to 2011 (Lee, Duszak, and Hughes, 2013). From 2006 to 2009, annual growth rates of CT and MRI utilization by Medicare beneficiaries declined from 7.1 percent to 1.4 percent and from 14 percent to 2.6 percent, respectively (Lee and Levy, 2012). Decreased growth also occurred in the commercial population, as annual growth rates of CT use dropped to 3.1 percent from 2006 to 2009. One study found a reduction in the per capita utilization growth rate for Medicare beneficiaries from 2004–2006 to 2006–2008 consistent with a 2.0-percentage point deceleration in the use of office and a 0.7-percentage point deceleration in the use of outpatient hospital musculoskeletal imaging per 1,000 Medicare beneficiaries (Kennedy and Foreman, 2012). Positive growth in advanced imaging stopped in 2010 (Figure 1.1), with a drop in the CT rate from 637 to 626 per 1,000 Medicare beneficiaries, equaling a –1.7 percent change in CT utilization (Levin, Rao, and Parker, 2012). While private-office settings exhibited the largest negative change (–7.8 percent), hospital outpatient departments reduced CT utilization by –3.6 percent (Levin, Rao, and Parker, 2012). 4', 'Figure 1.1. Growth in Volume of Physician Fee Schedule Services per Beneficiary, 2000–2011 SOURCE: Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), 2013. Lang et al. (2013) examined both MRI and CT utilization rates from 2000 to 2009 using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data. Combined MRI and CT rates increased during that period from 64.3 to 109.1 per 1,000 person years. However, the authors note that utilization annual growth rate was near 0 percent for the latter half of their study, in contrast to the 15-percent annual growth observed during the first five years. Medicare beneficiaries’ utilization rate ranged from 227 to 258 per 1,000 person years and was the highest utilization rate compared to utilization rates for patients with other types of insurance during the study period. 1.1.B. Reasons for Decline in Utilization The slowdown in volume of advanced imaging coincided with the onset of multiple policies. One of the most important factors was the Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) of 2005, which reduced payments for office-based imaging to hospital outpatient levels. One study found a correlation between lower reimbursement for office-based imaging procedures, as outlined by the DRA, and imaging growth rates in office settings for Medicare beneficiaries. By analyzing pre-DRA (2004 to 2006) and post-DRA (2006 to 2008) data, the authors found that each 1-percent cut in reimbursements for radiologists and nonradiologists resulted in utilization growth slowing by 0.2 percent (Kennedy and Foreman, 2012). In addition, payment cuts in the DRA may have led to larger declines in utilization in imaging centers and physician offices than in hospital outpatient settings (Lee and Levy, 2012). 5', 'Other policies—such as prior authorization, increased patient cost-sharing, and the use of radiology DSSs—may be more focused on the privately insured population but may have spillover effects in reducing advanced imaging utilization for the Medicare population. However, empirical evidence for spillover effects for the Medicare population have not been systematically documented. 1.1.C. Applying Appropriateness Methodology to Advanced Diagnostic Imaging Randomized clinical trials are generally agreed to be the highest quality evidence for generating data to support the effectiveness of interventions such as the use of advanced imaging. However, trial evidence is available for only a fraction of the interventions that are employed in clinical practice. In 1980, RAND introduced the concept of appropriateness ratings as one method for systematically synthesizing data from evidence reports and expert opinion where randomized trials were inadequate or unavailable (Fink et al., 1984; Brook et al., 1986). The method emphasized the importance of selecting a diverse set of experts who are free of conflicts of interest, providing a high-quality literature review using state of the art literature synthesis techniques, developing a precise set of specification of reasons for orders, and assigning ratings according to expected outcomes for a cohort of patients (not for a particular individual). With the RAND Appropriateness Methodology (Brook et al., 1986), indication lists are generated based upon procedure-specific medical literature. Indications are designed to be precise enough so that experts assigning appropriateness ratings would consider the benefits and risks of procedure use for patients who are homogeneous with respect to the reason for the order. The number of indications for a procedure is determined by the number of groupings that are distinct with respect to risks and benefits. Procedures are precisely defined (for example, by current procedural terminology [CPT] codes) and specify variations, such as with, without, or with and without the use of contrast. Patient characteristics are categorized according to potential reasons for the procedure, including well- specified symptoms (for example, describing the type, duration, intensity, and precipitating and relieving factors), past medical history (for example, describing prior diagnoses and associated timing), and signs and diagnostic studies (including the persistence, severity, and scope of the abnormalities). Experts are provided evidence-based literature reviews along with rating sheets with instructions for using the literature and for assigning appropriateness ratings based upon their best clinical judgment (informed b\n",

PROCESS: MONITORING PROGRESS AND MAINTAINING VIGILANCE Establishment and monitoring of indicators to assess performance improvement progress for key patient safety processes or outcomes, while maintaining continued vigilance to ensure timely detection and response to issues that represent patient safety risks and hazards. OVERVIEW The ability to assess performance on established patient safety measures is vital to the health care community for reducing the risk of harm to patients and the consequences of such harm. This information will also enable AHRQ to report to Congress on the results of its investments in patient safety research and dissemination so that appropriate adjustments can be made to the patient safety project investments. A major goal of the AHRQ patient safety initiative is to establish a national data capability that would enable aggregation of patient safety data from local, regional, and state levels, and allow for tracking of changes in patient safety performance across the country. Such a capability would eliminate the proliferation of varying reporting requirements that providers find burdensome and also enhance and support ongoing national efforts to address health care quality, access, and cost issues through strong national health information systems. AHRQ has been working to develop components of a data capability since 2002, although its progress has been hampered by the absence of formal authorization. With the passage of the PSQIA, AHRQ now has the formal authority to establish PSOs to which health care providers can report data with protection from legal discovery and to develop a national network of databases for aggregation of the reported data. Substantial challenges remain, however, particularly with respect to achieving consensus among varied stakeholders on standards for data content, definitions, and information-system design. We have reinforced the importance of this goal since the start of this evaluation. We stated in Evaluation Report I that a national data repository is a key component of the national patient safety initiative, but it is also one of the most difficult to achieve. Table 3.1 presents the evaluation questions regarding monitoring and vigilance activities addressed by this evaluation, as well as a brief assessment of current status for each question. These assessments draw upon results from all four years of the patient safety evaluation. In this chapter, we synthesize the evaluation results across the four evaluation years for each of the key components of a monitoring and vigilance system, including a focus on new information from the assessments performed in this final evaluation year. Our findings draw on information provided by relevant written materials and documents and interviews with AHRQ staff, other federal agency staff, representatives of state reporting systems, and principal investigators (PIs) for the AHRQ-funded projects. 17', 'Table 3.1 Evaluation Questions and Assessments for Monitoring and Vigilance Evaluation Question Summary Assessment What progress has been made in A modified Delphi consensus process was run by the establishing and using generally accepted evaluation center team in 2006, which identified important sets of measures for patient safety events outcome measures and assessed validity and measurement or outcomes in a range of health care issues for them. More work remains to validate many of service settings? these measures and address measurement issues and specifications. What progress has been made in AHRQ began work on this with funding to IOM for establishing a consistent set of standards preparation of its Data Standards report. With passage of for patient-safety reporting systems, for the PSQIA, AHRQ started work in 2006 to identify use by both government agencies and candidate standards for the data content of a national data health care providers? network and reach consensus on which standards to use. It will be important to achieve agreement on standards, which should complement the information technology standards being developed by DHHS. What actions have been taken to With passage of the PSQIA, AHRQ has been able to move establish a national-level patient safety forward with design of a data capability, under the data data repository? network provisions of the act. Plans to begin full implementation of the act in 2007, including progress on the national network of databases, were not met. Delays have hampered progress in both reporting and data. To what extent are national-level data Data availability continues to be extremely limited, with available regarding the performance of heavy reliance on the HCUP data. State reporting systems our health care system on patient safety have grown in number but vary widely in the measures and measures, and how has this changed? data they collect. No national-level data are available for ambulatory care, except Medicare data, which has not yet been used for patient safety measurement. More work is needed if effective outcome measurement is to happen. What is the status of the use of generally The primary organization using patient safety measures is accepted patient safety measures for the Joint Commission, which has had relevant policies in assessing performance as part of place for several years, specifically its sentinel events accreditation or other credentialing reporting policy. The National Quality Forum (NQF) processes? consensus process has made progress in establishing measure sets, but none of them has been used consistently across the country. Measures for both practice adoption and outcomes should be included. What steps need to be taken to enhance Further work is needed on each of the items listed above, to the capability for effective monitoring of continue progress toward establishing a national data patient safety performance? capability. Priority issues to be addressed include standardization of measures and standards, increased data availability at the national level, and measurement issues such as use of rates versus counts. 18', 'AHRQ-SUPPORTED WORK ON PATIENT SAFETY MONITORING SYSTEMS Since 2002, AHRQ has supported four key projects that address the requisite elements of a national data capability, which are summarized below. In addition, recent AHRQ activities related to patient safety monitoring systems are described in greater detail. • IOM project on patient safety data standards resulted in recommended standards for patient safety data systems that are under consideration for designing the national data repository (IOM, 2004). • Federal data system project yielded a technical product for integrating reporting of patient safety data from two existing federal reporting systems but stopped short of implementation due to financial issues and design constraints (AHRQ staff interviews). • Joint Commission taxonomy for patient safety reporting led to the development of the Patient Safety Event Taxonomy, endorsed by the NQF, which provides standards for consistent classification of reported events (Chang, 2005). The taxonomy has subsequently undergone validity testing using data for sentinel events and incident reports; additional work remains for establishing coding specifications and classifying events to ensure consistent application. • RAND study on the contents and standards of state adverse-event reporting systems generated a report documenting the data elements collected by state reporting systems and assessing consistency across states in data elements and IT standards (Beckett et al., 2006). Implementation of the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act More recently, AHRQ’s work to develop a national data network has focused on implementing the PSQIA enacted in 2005. In anticipation of the act’s passage, AHRQ began compiling information about existing reporting systems. Once the law was passed, AHRQ and other offices within DHHS began preparation for implementing the provisions of the legislation by developing (1) regulations with provisions for PSO designation and the structures and processes for reporting of data to these organizations; and (2) specifications for the national data network, including data definitions and standards and informatics standards. An interagency workgroup was convened with representation from several federal agencies, including the FDA, CDC, CMS, and HRSA, to assist AHRQ with implementation of the law. The development of the regulations has been conducted through a participatory process involving input from throughout DHHS, as well as the Department of Defense (DoD) and the VA. AHRQ also plans to develop the criteria for databases and data formats collaboratively with private-sector organizations. Survey on Hospital Patient Safety Adverse-Event Reporting Systems In spring 2006, RAND and the Joint Commission completed data collection for a national survey on adverse-event reporting systems in hospitals, utilizing an AHRQ-funded questionnaire developed and tested by Westat. AHRQ’s goal for this survey was to establish a national benchmark of adverse-event reporting systems used in hospitals and to enter the survey data into the national data repository. The survey also provides baseline data for the evaluation of the patient safety initiative. It is planned to conduct the survey a second time in the future, to measure how hospitals’ use of adverse-event reporting systems is changing over time. The Joint Commission has used data from the survey as part of its AHRQ-funded research grant to demonstrate and assess the value of health IT for hospitals. 19', 'Data were collected from a national random sample of 1,685 hospitals (81 percent response rate) regarding the existence and nature of their reporting systems, reporting of adverse events into the systems, and use of reported data for safety improvements. Overall, 98 percent of the hospitals had comprehensive reporting systems, but there was wide variation\n"

On the one hand, undertakings have to adhere to a healthcare policy framework mainly in- fluenced by patient safety and fiscal concerns. They however also benefit from opportunities to legally protect their products from product imitation. On the other hand, the behavior of pharmaceutical companies is governed by competition law. Although competition law doctrines are generally ap- plicable to all industry sectors, they enjoy certain special considerations when applied in the context of the drug industry’s characteristics. This chapter discusses important conflicts and opportunities of this governance framework relevant to analyze future implications on generic defense strategies. 2.1. Policy Objectives and Legal Protection 2.1.1. Conflicting Healthcare Policy Objectives In line with initiatives of national member states,16 the sector inquiry rearticulates the EU Commission’s general policy objective of “providing European patients with safe, effective and affordable medicines while at the same time creating a business environment that stimulates research, boosts valuable innovation and supports the competitiveness of the industry.”17 To promote these policy objectives, the EU Commission runs multiple pro- grams, such as the DG Research’s Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) for granting subsidies for integrated pharmaceutical industry’s research activ- ities.18 Nevertheless, realizing all goals simultaneously represents a great challenge due to two fundamental conflicts: 16 See supra note 10 at p.132 regarding the common goals of the member states. 17 Supra note 10 at p. 10 and p. 478; see also Commission of the European Communities, Safe, Innovative and Accessible Medicines: a Renewed Vision for the Pharmaceutical Sector, COM (2008) 666 final (Dec. 10, 2008). 18 See Satish Sule and Dominik Schnichels, Die Untersuchung des pharmazeutischen Wirtschaftszweigs durch die Kommission, 20 EuZW 129, 129 (2009). 17', 'First, regulatory safety and efficacy requirements come at the price of in- creased drug development (transaction) costs for pharmaceutical manufac- turers. Due to the scientific effort and high uncertainty involved, these costs are already naturally extremely high: Today, the development of an inno- vative drug from discovery to market can take 10-15 years and costs ap- proximately 450 million US$ to 1 billion US$ - and these investments still not yet eliminate the substantial risk of product liability.19 Regulatory re- quirements are thus targeted to protect European patients, but bear the risk of only fewer and/or more expensive products becoming available to these patients – especially in smaller/niche market segments.20 Secondly, promoting medical innovation requires incentives to increase the attractiveness for market participants to invest into complex, lengthy, ex- pensive and uncertain research and development (R&D) projects.21 As Shapiro argues, traditional approaches, such as granting IP rights, achieve this by allowing the owner of such a right to appropriate higher returns from its previous investments. This however typically inter alia leads to (tem- porarily) higher drug prices.22 This conflict is often referred to as the ‘in- novation vs. access trade-off’ or ‘innovation dilemma’.23 The fact that the EU Commission hereby explicitly stresses the promotion of (only) ‘valu- able’ innovation may articulate its skepticism about whether all medical innovations currently rewarded really contribute additional benefits to pa- tients.24 19 Compare Thomas C. Caskey, The Drug Development Crisis: Efficiency and Safety, 58 Ann. Rev. Med. 1, 1 (2007) and supra note 10 at p. 55 with Joseph A. DiMasi and Henry G. Grabowski, The Cost of Biopharmaceutical R&D: Is Biotech Different?, 28 Manag. Dec. Econ. 469 (2007) (estimating R&D average investments going even beyond 1 billion US$). 20 Higher transaction costs can lead to drug price increases to maintain profitability. Al- ternatively, it could also lead to lower profits assuming constant price levels. This bears the risk of drug manufacturing being a less attractive business to pursue. As a result, drug supply, especially in small market segments, may not be profitable, which may lead to lower availability of valuable medicine. 21 See supra note 13 at p. 1. 22 See Carl Shapiro, Antitrust Limits to Patent Settlements, 34 Rand J.

Thereby, a substantial part of the current healthcare system, especially pricing and reimbursement regulation, is not harmonized amongst EU member states and thus remains not under direct control of the EU legislator. Over the last years, especially the issue of price levels and affordability has gained greater attention, as overall healthcare costs have substantially in- creased.25 No surprise that healthcare spending on human pharmaceuticals is closely monitored, which today represents the third largest healthcare cost component across all OECD countries with disproportionately high growth rates.26 As confirmed by the sector inquiry, policy priorities in many EU member states have therefore already shifted towards a more rigid regulation of pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement.27 Although the EU Commission proclaims that its concerns about the decreasing rate of new drug applications in Europe had been one of their main motivations to initiate the sector inquiry,28 it seems that their true intention is rather driven by short-term considerations about “how to lower prices and reduce the strain on national health-care budgets.”29 2.1.2. Legal Protection of Pharmaceutical Products Besides the discussed restrictions derived from general policy concerns, the pharmaceutical industry on the other hand benefits from IP and other sui generis sector-specific exclusivity regimes. Although this being the cause for the above described ‘innovation dilemma’, pharmaceutical business models having such a heavy R&D burden, would simply not be possible without opportunities for legal protection of exclusivity. 25 Various factors have contributed to an increase in costs, e.g. the demographic develop- ment of Europe’s population and additional costs per capita due to more costly inno- vative therapies. 26 See supra note 10 at p.19. 27 For examples see supra note 10 at p.61. 28 See Press Release MEMO/09/321, European Commission, Antitrust: shortcomings in pharmaceutical sector require further action – frequently asked questions (Jul. 8, 2009). 29 Supra note 7. 19', 'Innovative pharmaceutical companies primarily benefit from patent pro- tection. Nevertheless, a complex set of additional pharma-specific exclu- sivities has been established to close incentive gaps of the patent sys- tem.30 As the protection terms of some of these exclusivity instruments add to each other while others overlap and run in parallel, the concept of ‘loss of exclusivity’ (LOE) is critical: An innovative drug has reached LOE when the total term, during which the sales of product imitations are legally pro- hibited, has come to an end. After this date, bioequivalent product imitations may be legally manufactured and sold on the market – typically at substan- tially lower prices. One can distinguish three different layers of such drug exclusivities: First, the exclusive rights conferred by patent law provide the basis of legal protection for a drug. As patents provide general incentives across all dif- ferent technologies and industry sectors, they do not consider the specific characteristics of the pharmaceutical industry. In order to compensate for the time between patent filing and marketing authorization, which can be rather long due to necessary drug development and regulatory approval procedures, Supplementary Protection Certificates (SPCs) may – under certain conditions – complement patent exclusivity terms with additional protection of maximum five years.31 SPCs therefore link a granted patent right with the independent regulatory regime of pharmaceutical marketing authorization – not without certain inconsistency problems and legally un- clear situations.32 A major change in the patent regime was introduced by the so called ‘Bolar exemption’, which has provided much more leeway for the market entry preparation of bioequivalent product imitations.33 Prior to its introduction, patent protection did not only make the third party manufacturing and sales 30 A full discussion about pharmaceutical protection regimes would go beyond the scope of this thesis.

INTRODUCTION Tariffs are like Hydras: they create more problems than they solve. Tariffs on pharmaceutical products are a case in point. By levying import tariffs on pharmaceutical products, the governments of many low and middle-income countries, including the world’s major low and middle-income economies, explicitly aim to maintain a source of government income and, at the same time, protect domestic producers from foreign competition. However, by squeezing out financial rents from the import of much-needed medicinal products, these governments impair the affordability of these products for low income patients in their countries. Unlike high-income countries, patients in low and middle-income countries largely pay for medicines out of their own pockets and, in addition, suffer from a great number of inefficiencies along regional value chains for medicinal products. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Even low import tariff rates have a significant prevailing trade facilitation inefficiencies is substantial net losses for governments, compounding effect on the final retail price highest for China (up to 6.2bn USD), Russia taxpayers and patients, they effectively of medicines, which in turn impacts on (up to 2.8bn USD), Brazil (up to 2.6bn USD) work as a subsidy for companies along affordability.

It was declared a fundamental human right in the Constitution of the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1946, stating that “[t]he enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being [...]” and that “[g]overnments have a responsibility for the health of their peoples which can be fulfilled only by the provision of adequate health and social measures.” (WHO 1946, p. 1; see also Sammut and Levine 2016 and Goel 2015). While access to medicine is not a human right except, in those countries which have specifically codified the right to health in their constitutions (mainly South American countries), it is regarded by the United Nations a fundamental element of the right to health and governments are obliged to develop national health legislation and policies to strengthen their national health systems. For this purpose, key issues related to access to medicines, such as affordability of essential medicines, procurement practices and supply chains, must be taken into account (OHCHR 2017). Improving health equity is a major priority in global development policymaking. In international development cooperation frameworks, such as the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda that came into force in 2016, improvements in global health and, more specifically, “making essential medicines and vaccines affordable” has become a top-tier priority once again. According to the United Nations’ official announcements, policy areas to be addressed comprise research and development (R&D), intellectual property rights policies (IPRs), healthcare finance and improvements in the management of national and global health risks (UN 2015). In line with these overarching objectives, the UN Secretary General’s High-Level Panel on Access to Medicines recently called on private sector pharmaceutical companies to cooperate with governments, particularly in providing enhanced access to information regarding R&D costs, production costs, marketing and pricing practices and the distribution of healthcare products and technologies (UN 2016). There is, however, one fundamental piece that is missing in expert analyses, policy discussions and the public debate about global health and access to medicines respectively: tariffs and taxation. Access to medicines is also a function of prices and affordability (WHO 2004), which are directly affected by national trade policies and regional taxation practices. As concerns trade policy, the UN High Panel indeed acknowledges that “[t]rade and intellectual property rules were not developed with the goal of protecting the right to health, just as human rights doctrine does not primarily concern itself with promoting trade or reducing tariffs.” (UN 2016, p 16). At the same time, the Panel does not at all address frictions in the system that are caused by national trade policies, i.e. import duties (tariffs) and other protectionist policies, beyond matters related to the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) Agreement on Trade- Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). In other words, much of the “trade in medicines” debate is about intellectual property rights (IPRs) and, often, about putting the blame on pharmaceutical manufacturers, while tariffs and the quality of governance and taxation are swept under the political carpet. As a result, and as will be shown below, many governments still unnecessarily, but substantially, inflate the cost of medicines through import tariffs, taxation and other domestic regulations. During the Uruguay Round negotiations (1989 to 1994), several major trading partners agreed to reciprocal tariff elimination - a “zero-for-zero initiative” - for pharmaceutical products and for chemical intermediates used in the production of pharmaceuticals. The “Pharmaceutical Tariff Elimination Agreement” was agreed by 22 countries (Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, European Communities, Japan, Norway, Slovak Republic, Sweden, Switzerland, and the US) and entered into force on 1 January 1995. Due to the EU’s enlargement, there are now 34 signatories to the zero-for-zero pharmaceutical agreement, which enshrines a commitment to zero tariffs on medicinal products that are imported from abroad and aims to not replace tariff barriers with non-tariff trade barriers. The treaty even extends to cover products imported from states not signatory to the zero-for-zero agreement, including low and middle-income countries. 2', 'ecipe policy brief — 1/2017 Most developing countries are still net importers of pharmaceuticals, but many impose tariffs and non-tariff barriers (NTBs) on finished drugs, active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), and excipients (inactive substances that contain the active ingredients). As shown by Banik and Stevens (2015), a larger proportion of globally marketed medicinal products are now potentially subject to tariffs and other trade barriers, increasing upstream prices along the distribution chain of these medicines. Accordingly, the impact of import tariffs on pharmaceutical products gained in relative importance and adverse distortions of markets and consumer welfare increased significantly in absolute terms (see analysis below). Compared to policies that aim to tackle local frictions in the distribution of medicines, such as a lack of education, high levels of corruption, lack of medical advisory capacities or the lack of domestic innovative capacities, the elimination of tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be low hanging fruit. It would enhance access to medicine and contribute to the realisation of the right to health in low and middle-income countries. For various reasons, such as maintaining tariff revenues and the facilitation of contentious national industrial policies, low and middle-income countries have not yet signed up to this agreement. Tariffs and NTBs, however, substantially contribute to pharmaceutical costs by increasing the final price of medicines, thus limiting access for the poorest people. As already outlined by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2005, “[t]ariffs on medicines are essentially a regressive form of taxation since a smaller proportion of the payers’ income is affected by the tariff as income rises. This regressive ‘tax’ on medicines targets the poor and the sick” (Olcay and Laing 2005, p. 2).

This position has now changed. All members of the WTO are required to adopt patent laws that comply with the Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights,1 including the implementation of patent protection for pharmaceuticals. The developed members of the WTO negotiated mandatory protection for pharmaceutical products and processes in the TRIPS Agreement on the basis that such mandatory protection will provide the necessary incentives for continued pharmaceutical innovation. In contrast, the developing countries and the Least Developed Countries argued that enacting patent laws that comply with TRIPS may restrict production and supply of low-cost generic medicines by their local pharmaceutical industries or by the pharmaceutical industries in other developing countries, and hence could increase the price of pharmaceuticals to the point that pharmaceuticals become inaccessible to their populations. The LDCs need to reorganise and restructure national IP legislation and related institutional and infrastructural set-ups for the implementation of the TRIPS Agreement.

Later, by a decision of the Council for TRIPS on 29 November 2005, LDC members as a group were granted an extension of the transitional period for 7.5 years to apply the provisions of the TRIPS Agreement “until 1 July 2013, or until such a date on which they cease to be an LDC member, whichever date is earlier”. The Council for TRIPS took the decision following the request by the LDCs as a group, pursuant to Article 66.1 of the TRIPS Agreement, for a 15-year extension of the transition period in order for those LDCs to be able to apply the provisions of the agreement. The group had cited socioeconomic, administrative and financial constraints, as well as the need to create a viable technological base, as reasons duly motivating the request. The decision was negotiated between the LDCs and some key developed countries during informal consultations and was adopted by the formal Council for TRIPS meeting on 29 November 2005. However, during the consultations, several developed country members, particularly the United States of America (the US), insisted that each LDC member should request an extension on an individual basis and that extensions would be granted on a case-by-case basis. 2 There are no World Trade Organisation definitions of ‘developed’ or ‘developing’ countries. Least-developed Countries, ‘Understanding the WTO: The Organization’, World Trade Organization, http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/ org7_e.htm. “The WTO recognizes as [LDCs] those countries which have been designated as such by the United Nations. There are currently 48 [LDCs] on the UN list, 34 of which to date have become WTO members” (ibid.). According to the United Nations, LDCs are countries that exhibit the lowest indicators of socioeconomic development, with the lowest human development index (HDI) ratings of all the countries in the world. A country is classified as an LDC if it meets three criteria: low income (three-year average GNI per capita of less than $992, which must exceed $1,190 to leave the list), human resources weakness (based on indicators of nutrition, health, education and adult literacy) and economic vulnerability (based on instability of agricultural production, instability of exports of goods and services, economic importance of non-traditional activities, merchandise export concentration, handicap of economic smallness and the percentage of population displaced by natural disasters). However, countries “graduate” from the LDC classification when indicators exceed these criteria (ibid.).

Setting the Scene 3 Nevertheless, given the recognition of the extent of the restructuring required and the vulnerability of the LDCs, the transition period did not prove to be long enough to introduce protection for pharmaceutical patents and to take adequate measures to ensure access to medicines. Therefore, the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health (known as the Doha Declaration) was adopted by the WTO Ministerial Conference of 2001 in Doha on 14 November 2001, extending the transitional period for LDCs to introduce pharmaceutical patent protection until 1 January 2016.4 On the other hand, WTO members agreed on 11 June 2013 to further extend the deadline for LDCs until 1 July 2021 to protect IP under the TRIPS Agreement.5 It was noted that the decision could not prejudice the extension of pharmaceutical patents granted under the Doha declaration and that LDCs could seek further extensions to this period. Accordingly, on behalf of the LDC group, Bangladesh submitted a document requesting extension of the waiver for the LDCs with respect to pharmaceutical patents as long as the WTO Member remains a Least Developed Country pursuant to Article 66.1 of the TRIPS Agreement.6 The LDC group stated that LDCs are “struggling to provide their population with prevention, treatment and care. Patent protection contributes to high costs, placing many critical treatments outside the reach of LDCs”.7 Justifying the request for extension, the LDCs further pled “special needs and requirements of least developed country Members, their economic, financial and administrative constraints and their need for flexibility to create a viable technological base”.8 The Council for TRIPS approved the waiver for pharmaceutical patents until 1 January 2033 or until such a date on which the least developed countries cease to be LDC Members, whichever date comes first.9 Granting the extension is seen as being in line with both the 4 See WTO, ‘Decision of the Council for TRIPS on the Extension of the Transition Period under Article 66.1 of the TRIPS Agreement for Least-developed Country Members for Certain Obligations with Respect to Pharmaceutical Products’, 27 June 2002 (Document IP/C/25). 5 WTO, ‘Decision of the Council for TRIPS of 11 June 2013’ (Document IP/C/64). 6 WTO, ‘Communication from Bangladesh on behalf of the LDC Group’, 23 February 2015 (Document IP/C/W/605). 7 Ibid. 8 Ibid. 9 WTO, ‘Decision of the Council for TRIPS of 6 November 2015’ (Document IP/C/73).', '4 Intellectual Property and Public Health in the Developing World Doha Declaration and the Sustainable Development Goals. The SDGs were adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in September 2015, approving seventeen goals to be pursued by all countries to end poverty and to fight inequality and injustice. They represent an important milestone in envisioning what the world could look like in 2030, if global development is put on an inclusive and sustainable path. Among the seventeen goals, the third set targets to ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all ages and also to achieve universal health coverage, including access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all.10 It (SDG 3) further affirmed the right of developing countries to utilise TRIPS Agreement flexibilities to ensure access to medicines for all.11 With the deadlines of 2033 (the extension) and 2030 (the SDGs) in mind, it is important for the LDCS to take concrete and coherent steps to improve intellectual property and health-related infrastructure to ensure healthy lives and access to medicines for their citizens. Therefore, it is vital for the LDCs to utilise the transitional period properly to initiate infrastructural and institutional capacity building, so that after the expiration of the transitional period, they will be able to balance pharmaceutical innovation and access to medicines. Among the 48 countries classified as LDCs (of which 34 are WTO members),12 Bangladesh is one of the few with an adequate pharmaceutical manufacturing capability, and it is nearly self- sufficient in pharmaceuticals.13 Bangladesh’s pharmaceutical industry now accounts for 97% of the country’s pharmaceutical needs (the remaining 3% includes insulin, vaccines and high-end, anti-cancer drugs, the production of which are very capital intensive and hence not economically feasible for Bangladesh), which amounts to around 10 M.

The Globalising Standard of Patent Protection in WTO Law and Policy Options for the LDCs: The Context of Bangladesh 4.1 Introduction This chapter analyses the globalising standard of patent protection as adopted under the TRIPS Agreement of the WTO and measures it against the experiences of Brazil, India and South Africa in order to identify possible options for the LDCs,1 with special reference to pharmaceutical patent issues. The developed member states of the WTO negotiated mandatory protection for pharmaceutical products and processes in the TRIPS Agreement, on the basis that such mandatory protection would provide the incentive for continued pharmaceutical innovation. In contrast, the developing countries and LDCs argued that enacting patent laws that comply with the TRIPS Agreement would restrict production and supply of low-cost generic medicines by their local pharmaceutical industries or by the pharmaceutical industries in other developing countries, and hence could increase the price of pharmaceuticals to the point that they become inaccessible to their populations. During the TRIPS negotiations, it was argued that the principle of a balance of rights and obligations was required because IP owners needed to undertake certain obligations in return for the exclusive rights conferred on them, and also to allow governments to take remedial 1 See for details, Criteria for Identification and Graduation of LDCs, UN-OHRLLS, http:// unohrlls.org/about-ldcs/criteria-for-ldcs © Monirul Azam, CC BY http://dx.doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0093.04', '150 Intellectual Property and Public Health in the Developing World measures in the case of non-fulfilment of these obligations so that IPRs could promote industrial creativity to benefit society in general.2 This principle was generally recognised in pre-existing IP conventions and in the national laws of many countries:3 “The acceptance of this principle was aimed at assuring the access of developing countries to modern technology, eliminating non-use, misuse or abusive use of IPRs, especially with a view to avoiding trade distortions, and allowing the flexibility in the intellectual property protection for the public interest and the developmental and technological needs of developing countries” and LDCs.4 Therefore, the principle of balance of rights and obligations could be used while also employing other flexibilities of the TRIPS Agreement. It was further suggested that the TRIPS Agreement should take into account the application of the GATT principle of securing a balance of rights and obligations among parties.5 However, as in the case of the principle of public interest, the application of the principle of balance of rights and obligations was adopted with the lock of the consistency test. As worded in TRIPS Article 8.2, any measure taken under the umbrella of this article must be “consistent with” the provisions of the TRIPS Agreement.6 Moreover, the extents to which a practice is regarded as “unreasonably” restraining trade or “adversely” affecting the international transfer of technology and to which a national response against such practices is regarded as an appropriate measure are ambiguous under article 8.2. These unclear conditions leave room for interpretation, and create difficulties in applying the principle of balance of rights and obligations. Considering the room for interpretation of TRIPS flexibilities and practices for countries like India, Brazil and 2 GATT, Negotiating Group on TRIPs, ‘Including Trade in Counterfeit Goods’, Meeting of Negotiating Group of 11–13 September 1989, GATT Doc.

The Globalising Standard of Patent Protection 151 South Africa, this chapter explores possible options for Bangladesh while it complies with patent provisions under the TRIPS Agreement. Brazil, India and South Africa used TRIPS flexibilities in different ways to modify their national patent regimes to become TRIPS- compliant,7 though they experienced some difficulties with respect to the legislative measures they enacted.8 However, the legislative provisions were found to be within the scope of the flexibilities of the TRIPS Agreement. Bangladesh, as an LDC, faces similar public health challenges but also has the potential to become a substantial (global) producer of generic medicines. The need to balance these competing interests (pharmaceutical innovation and access to pharmaceuticals) means that there are good grounds for Bangladesh to use the Indian, Chinese, Brazilian and South African experiences as a way to guide 7 For example, Brazil implemented a system of compulsory licensing. See ‘The Politics of Patents and Drugs in Brazil and Mexico’, p.41. India’s experience was very different. It entered the WTO in 1995 and went through a long amendment process to institute a TRIPS-compliant patent regime, which became effective on 1 January 2005. See ‘India’s New “Trips-compliant” Patent Regime’, p.95. The effect of stronger intellectual patent rights created problems for the larger Indian drug firms and greatly damaged the ability of smaller local firms to meet the rising costs of royalties and remuneration of experienced and efficient pharmacists and other technical people. See ‘Note: Pharmaceutical Patents and TRIPS’, pp.911, 924–25. 8 For example, the DSB of the WTO established a panel, as requested by the US, to look into the complaint about the patent laws of Brazil in 2001, which the US claimed illegally required the local working of patents and enabled compulsory licensing of the patent, or the authorisation of imports of the patented product (parallel imports), without the authorisation of the patent holder. See WTO, Brazil: Measures Affecting Patent Protection, Dispute Settlement: Dispute DS199, http://www. wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds199_e.htm. However, due to massive public pressure and campaigns by public health groups, both parties negotiated it outside the DSB. See ibid. In contrast, Indian patent law was challenged even in the Indian courts by an MNPC, Novartis, claiming that it was inconsistent with some of the provisions of the TRIPS Agreement.

Another major concern is the confiscation of generic Indian medicines used to treat illnesses such as AIDS and hypertension in several European countries, regarding which India and Brazil complained to the WTO, saying that the European Union (EU) had wrongfully confiscated generic medicines.

It is crucial for Bangladesh to use these experiences to develop IPR policies that preserve the full complement of TRIPS flexibilities. In this regard, a comment by Rochelle Cooper Dreyfuss is worth noting: “These practices [of India, Brazil, South Africa, and other developing countries] achieve international recognition as they are defended in international courts and put on the agendas of international organizations”.9 Therefore, “domestic actors then may interpret the law in a particular way that allows them to offer a new approach that others may choose to emulate”.10 While evaluating the possible policy options for LDCs to balance pharmaceutical innovation and access to medicines against the experiences of Brazil, India and South Africa in complying with the TRIPS-compliant patent law, relevant discussions, policies and recommendations as formulated in the WHO will also be indicated. The discussions here do not use the experience of China, because China has a very strong technological base, critical bargaining capacity and substantial market power; therefore the Chinese perspective is not relevant for the LDCs. This chapter explores possible legislative and government intervention options for Bangladesh, utilising the experiences of Brazil, India and, to some extent, South Africa (as the South African patent law has yet to introduce a substantive patent examination process, some of the important policy options such as disclosure, high threshold, novelty, pre-grant and post-grant requirements have not been well tested in South Africa). It also reflects on the relevant policy issues and recommendations from the WHO. This chapter uses legal doctrinal analysis, comparative review and field research in Bangladesh, by way of surveys and interviews aimed at understanding stakeholders’ perceptions of the various policy options available under the TRIPS Agreement.

            "['Conclusion The Canadian government’s proposed amendments to the PMPRB call for the increasing incorporation into the PMPRB’s regulatory process of cri- teria used in public reimbursement decisions (particularly cost-effectiveness evaluations) by agencies such as CADTH. As such, the direction of Canadian regulatory policy seems to put more emphasis on controlling expenditures on pharmaceuticals than on ensuring access of Canadians to new therapies. Canada is not unique in implementing measures to contain expenditures on drugs. In fact, policymakers around the world face a similar challenge in balancing patient access to effective medicines with affordability. As such, governments and public insurers employ a mix of regulatory mechanisms to contain pharmaceutical expenditures. In particular, the use of cost-effective- ness analysis and reference pricing to regulate pricing and reimbursement of drugs is widespread. Our discussion highlights the potential for conventional cost-effective- ness analysis, as well as other efforts by governments to contain the costs of new medical technologies, including pharmaceuticals, to discourage techno- logical change. They can also delay access to new and effective therapies. These concerns augment a more general phenomenon that Philipson (2016) discusses in detail. Namely, national health care authorities have incentives to “free-ride” on the research and development (R&D) activities carried out in other countries. The basis of Philipson’s argument is that medical R&D is driven by world returns to R&D undertaken by pharmaceutical companies and not by the returns from individual domestic markets. Therefore, taxation to fund the reimbursements and profits to the health care industry involves a private (country-specific) cost with a worldwide benefit through stimulating innovation. It follows that if medical innovation benefits all countries, any individual country has an incentive to reimburse manufacturers at less than the socially efficient rate from a multi-country perspective. As a result, there will be too little medical innovation from a global perspective given the public goods characteristic of pharmaceutical R&D. New and innovative therapies, particularly personalized medicine, offer the potential for major improvements in the therapeutic effectiveness 14 / fraserinstitute.org', 'Pharmaceutical regulation, innovation, and access to new drugs: An international perspective / 15 of new drug therapies.18 A growing emphasis of public (or statutory) insurers on cost containment, including in the United States, could undermine what might be a revolutionary technological regime that will bring major gains in longevity and health status. In essence, there is a large multinational option value to encouraging ongoing drug development activities. Policymakers in developed countries especially need to address the existence of “gains from cooperating” in bearing the (admittedly high) near-term costs of new drug development. As noted earlier, the potential is growing for stronger cost con- tainment efforts to be imposed on drug expenditures by the US government under Medicare. Since the US accounts for around 40 percent of world phar- maceutical expenditures (Philipson, 2016), new cost containment actions by the US could severely threaten spending by drug companies on developing new therapies unless other countries loosen their own cost controls. In rethinking existing and prospective cost containment strategies, policymakers should also implement procedures that recognize the “life-cycle” benefits of new drugs, including the knowledge externalities that new drugs provide future research efforts. While difficult to do, it is clearly inappropri- ate to adjust prices downward if new drugs fail to provide their anticipated benefits, while not retroactively rewarding manufacturers that produce break- through therapies offering therapeutic benefits and knowledge externalities that were not perfectly anticipated. As well, once a new drug is developed, the incremental cost of treating patients with that drug is relatively low. So while a new drug might create financing problems from a short-run perspec- tive, the problem becomes much less relevant in the longer run. Adopting a longer-run policy perspective for drug reimbursement and pricing policies is critical to the health of future generations. As Garrison and Towse (2017) conclude, if pricing and reimbursement policies within and across countries, as well as across distinct diagnostic and treatment develop- ments, do not efficiently share costs and reward value appropriately, the global rate of innovation will be sub-optimal, with a long-run adverse impact on public health. 18. The OECD (2017) highlights the growth of personalized medicines in recent years. Such treatments accounted for more than 25 percent of drugs approved by the US regu- lator in 2015. fraserinstitute.org', '20 / Pharmaceutical regulation, innovation, and access to new drugs: An international perspective Publishing information Distribution These publications are available from <http://www.fraserinstitute.org> in Portable Document Format (PDF) and can be read with Adobe Acrobat Pro® or Adobe Acrobat Reader®, versions 8/9 or later.

MANNING INTRODUCTION The world may be fast approaching the perfect storm, with the intersection of two major global trends. At a moment of historic transition, when the post-WWII and post-Cold War international order is eroding amid competing visions of world order and renewed geopolitical rivalries, the world is also in the early stages of an unprecedented technological transformation. It promises to be a period of exponential change, the second—and far more disruptive—chapter of the digital revolution that began with the Internet in the 1990s.

This report along with a companion one on trade and finance are the first fruits of that effort to probe the challenges to global stability and to recommend solutions boosting global cooperation. This and the companion report have been informed by multiple exchanges with global experts from the United States, Europe, Russia, India, and China. Additionally, the webpage we are planning will include other related work and, over time, future work on the topic of multilateral cooperation, which we believe is the only way forward to ensure peace and prosperity.', 'EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES: New Challenges To Global Stability the horizon, quantum computing.

Around the world, many countries have shown strong interest in these technologies as technological progress has become the main driver for development. Some coun- tries and companies have adapted quickly to the changing environment, navigating these waves of technological advancement and increasing their productivity and economic growth.

DoD Contract Spending in a Budgetary Context Before looking at specific questions on the state of defense acquisition, it is helpful to understand how DoD’s contract spending fits into the larger budgetary picture. To allow for a like-to-like comparison, CSIS compared DoD contract obligations to total DoD obligations, shown in Figure 3-1. These totals include contract spending associated with foreign military sales through the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), and therefore may not match those reported by other sources.11 Figure 3-1: Defense Contract Obligations vs. Total Net Obligations, 2008–201512 Source: FPDS; DoD Comptroller Financial Summary tables; CSIS analysis. In this chart, the blue bar shows total DoD contract obligations, while the red bar shows total net DoD obligations, which includes both contract and noncontract obligations. The green line, which uses the secondary axis on the right, shows contract obligations as a share of total net obligations. Overall DoD contract obligations peaked at $421 billion in 2009 following a steady increase throughout the 2000s. Total net DoD obligations similarly peaked in 2009, at $780 billion. Between 2009 and 2015, overall DoD contract obligations declined by 35 percent. Despite 11 See Appendix A, Methodology, for details on how CSIS calculates total net obligations. 12 This chart includes data starting in 2008 because, while the required DoD comptroller data for overall DoD is available starting in FY2003, DSCA data are only broken out separately starting in FY2008. Defense Acquisition Trends, 2016 | 7', 'the declines in both DoD contract and net DoD obligations, the result of steady year-to-year declines initially associated with decreases in the Overseas Contingency Operations account, and accelerated in 2013 due to the impact of sequestration and the imposition of lower Budget Control Act caps, however, the shape of these declines exhibits substantial differences between contract obligations and noncontract obligations. Total net DoD obligations were largely steady from 2009–2012 before declining by 21 percent in 2013 alone, notably more steeply than the 15 percent decline for contract obligations in that year. For the entire 2009–2015 period, however, total net DoD obligations have declined by 25 percent, notably less steeply than for contract obligations. As a share of total net DoD obligations, contract obligations declined from 56 percent in 2008 to 48 percent in 2012, then rose to 52 percent in 2013, and have remained at 47 percent in 2014 and 2015. Contract obligations accounted for more than half of total net DoD obligations from 2008 to 2011, but noncontract obligations have accounted for more than half of total DoD obligations in three of the four years since. The only exception was 2013, the first year where the impact of sequestration is visible in the data, where noncontract obligations actually declined slightly more steeply than contract obligations. The divergence in trends between contract and noncontract obligations may be a temporary phenomenon, however. In 2015, both total net DoD obligations and DoD contract obligations declined by 5 percent. This represents a notable slowing of the rate of decline for DoD contract obligations and may indicate that the decline in contract obligations has reached its floor. If nothing else, the data may indicate that trends in contract obligations may be more closely tied to trends in total net obligations in the near term, rather than declining independently of trends in total net obligations. And while CSIS is still processing the data on total net DoD obligations in 2016, the significant increase in contract obligations discussed in Chapter 2 make it likely that the decline of contract obligations as a share of total DoD obligations is at an end. And given the defense spending increase Congress provided in 2016 and the gradually increasing course of defense spending laid out in the last several years of the Budget Control Act through 2021, the future looks reasonably positive for DoD contracting. All of this, of course, is subject to adherence to the budget caps put in place by the Budget Control Act. While a budget agreement to significantly modify those caps has been elusive, the possibility remains that they could be adjusted, driving more substantial changes in DoD contract obligations. Additionally, with a new administration that campaigned on increasing defense budgets, and a Congress that seems amenable to going along with that policy, it seems likely that there will be more money available to DoD for contracting in the coming years. 8 | Ellman, Cohen, Hunter, Johnson, McCormick, Sanders', '6. From Whom Is DoD Buying It is impossible to discuss trends in DoD contracting without a parallel discussion of the state of the defense industrial base. Increasingly, and for the foreseeable future, DoD depends upon private-sector vendors for platforms, equipment, and supplies to support operations and readiness, and to innovate in order to maintain DoD’s technological advantage over current and potential adversaries. While DoD’s primary responsibilities are to provide warfighters with the tools and support they need to perform their missions, and to be good stewards of the taxpayers’ money, DoD must also pay attention to the impact of conditions and decisions on the health of the defense industrial base. This chapter seeks to analyze the impact of the budget drawdown on the defense of the industrial base in two ways. The first section looks at changes in the composition of the defense industrial base, as measured by the share of contract obligations going to different size categories of vendors. The second section examines the top vendors in the different market areas of the defense industrial base, and looks at changes in the concentration of those market areas within that top-tier of prim\n",

Why? In large part, because the current crop of nonproliferation understandings are ill-suited to check the spread of emerging long-range missile, biological, and nuclear technologies. Attempts to develop a legally binding inspections protocol to the Biological Weapons Convention, for example, were recently rejected by U.S. officials as being inadequate to catch serious violators while being prone to set off false alarms against perfectly innocent actors. Missile defense and unmanned air vehicle (UAV) related technologies, meanwhile, are proliferating for a variety of perfectly defensive and peaceful civilian applications. This same know-how can be used to defeat U.S. and allied air and missile defenses in new ways that are far more stressful than the existing set of ballistic missile threats. Unfortunately, the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) is not yet optimized to cope with these challenges. Finally, nuclear technologies have become much more difficult to control. New centrifuge uranium enrichment facilities and relatively small fuel reprocessing plants can now be built and hidden much more readily than nuclear fuel-making plants that were operating when the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and the bulk of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections procedures were first devised 30 or more years ago. This volume is designed to highlight what might happen if these emerging threats go unattended and how best to mitigate them. The book, which features research the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center commissioned, is divided into three sections. The first, Life in a Well-Armed Crowd, focuses on what a world proliferated with these technologies might look like. The first chapter, “Alternative Proliferation and Alliance Futures in East Asia” by Stephen Kim of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, projects how the United States, Japan, Korea, and China will relate and compete with one another as each becomes more competent to deploy strategic weaponry. The good news is that further proliferation and war in the Far East are not inevitable. The bad news is that it will take considerable effort to avoid this fate. Much is the same in the Middle East as Patrick Clawson of the Washington Institute makes clear in Chapter 2, “Proliferation in the Middle East: Who is Next after Iran?” Here, the lynch pin for further proliferation is Iran. Certainly, if Iran is able to edge toward nuclear bomb making capabilities', 'with impunity, Tehran’s neighbors are likely to hedge their security bets by developing strategic weapons options of their own. This, then, brings us to this section’s final chapter, “Nuclear 1914: The Next Big Worry.” In it, I argue that the greatest security danger renewed strategic arms proliferation presents is not the increased chance of nuclear theft or terrorism, so much as the increasing difficulty small and large nations will have in determining who they can rely upon and how militarily capable they might be. In such a world, even the best plans and diplomatic hedging may be incapable of preventing miscalculation and war, much as was the case in 1914 with World War I. The book’s second section, New Proliferation Worries, details three of the most important emerging proliferation technology threats we face—the spread of new biological, missile, and nuclear technologies. As detailed in Mitchell Kugler’s chapter, “Missile Defense Cooperation and the Missile Technology Control Regime,” the United States has a clear desire to encourage missile defense cooperation with its friends and allies even though key portions of the technologies in question are restricted by the MTCR. Mr. Kugler of the Boeing Corporation makes it clear that he believes the case for sharing this technology is stronger than the case for restricting it. He believes that the MTCR should be changed to allow such commerce, or it should be put aside. Current nuclear controls also are being challenged by emerging technology, as former U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commissioner Victor Gilinsky makes clear in his comprehensive chapter, “A Fresh Examination of the Proliferation Dangers of Light Water Reactors.” This detailed history and technical analysis of the proliferation resistance of the most popular type of power reactor concludes that the current international nuclear safeguards system needs to be modified to cope with the new risks that a proliferating state might divert the fresh or spent fuel from these machines to small, covert reprocessing or enrichment plants that could bring a state within days of having a small arsenal of weapons. In the biological weapons threat field, current control approaches are also in desperate need of help. Dr. Allan Zelicoff explains precisely what can and is being done that can be of immediate use with health monitoring in his chapter, “Coping with Biological Threats after SARS.” What is reassuring is how much public health monitoring can and has accomplished to identify and immediately treat outbreaks of infectious disease. What is challenging is how much more can and needs to be done. All of this is laid out in Dr. Zelicoff’s chapter. This brings us to the book’s final section, What Can Be Done. In the missile technology area, Dennis Gormley and Richard Speier identify i', 'what specific new missile defense and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technologies should be added to the MTCR control lists. Their chapter, “New Missiles and Models for Cooperation,” also explains how the United States and other advanced states might share UAV services and turn-key missile systems rather than handing over the means for their production or, in the case of missile defenses, the countermeasures technologies needed to defeat them.

This new e-magazine is a collection of our board members, fellows and members of the Consensus for American Security writings over the last quarter. In the following editions we will be publishing original content as well as a round up from our other key work. This edition of the American Security Quarterly shows that the last quarter of 2011 was packed full with the key issues that are facing our nation. We have a signature article by our board member Norm Augustine on the growing research and development gap facing America. As a percentage of GDP, the U.S. ranks eighth, behind Japan, South Korea, and even Iceland. He notes: “China is investing in science, engineering, manufacturing, energy and transportation.... It now dominates the United States in the manufacture of clean energy technologies. China has leaped over its global competitors, both in the United States and in Europe, in the making of wind turbines and solar panels.” Consensus members - Brig. Gen. John Adams and Lt. Col. Chris Courtney – discuss the need to have a full strategic plan in dealing with Iran. They state: “We must choose policy options likely to prevent both a nuclear-armed Iran and the outbreak of regional war.” This will be a key issue for 2012. We need to make sure we work to achieve both these aims, and not walk blindly into military action. On the energy front we have articles on the potential for fusion power, the need for international emissions reductions, and how we can break the choke hold of oil. ASP Senior Fellow Andrew Holland noted: “America faces a series of significant challenges regarding how we produce energy over the next several decades. Our current energy system undermines our national security, is economically unstable, and environmentally unsustainable.” The last quarter also marked the 10-year anniversary of action in Afghanistan. We published a major report from ASP Fellow, Joshua Foust, discussing the need to properly define strategy and metrics in the conflict there. In an accompanying piece, he argues: “The real challenge in Afghanistan is that the American effort (as measured by money, people and attention) has focused almost exclusively on the military, while the Taliban has focused on politics...The Taliban is winning the war for hearts and minds.” As we saw the year out, The Atlantic, in conjunction with ASP published a 12 essay series on the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Soviet Union. In the introduction piece, ASP Chairman, Sen. Gary Hart, wrote: “We spent a half-century army-to-army and missile- to-missile. The time will come, and none too soon, when it will be beneficial to both of us to stand shoulder- to- shoulder.” We hope you will continue to read and follow our work throughout 2012 and following years. We believe that is only with sustained non-partisan engagement, setting out the national security issues, explaining the challenges, and offering strategic advice can we spur real constructive action.

            "['47 2 analy tical framework: information, actors and principles Commentators have noted countless times that digitization is having an unprece- dented impact on society. The dozens of reports published on ict in recent years use adjectives such as revolutionary developments, unique opportunities, complex tensions, fundamental changes, shifting interests and obsolete social and institu- tional contexts. But why, precisely, is digitization having such an unparalleled impact? Why should commentators refer to the related opportunities, tensions, shifts and challenges as ‘fundamental’, ‘unique’ or ‘complex’? And if all that is true, what are the consequences of digitization for the relationship between government and the citizen? If we set these qualifications to the side and examine the features that make ict ‘different’ or ‘new’, we see that the nature of digitiza- tion is less uniform than it may at first appear. Although the term ‘digitization’ suggests a clear-cut, well-defined phenomenon, everyday reality teaches us that it in fact consists of a wide variety of trends and developments, technological break- throughs and specific applications. Each of these trends, breakthroughs and appli- cations is initiated and, gradually, influenced by the many different actors involved, their interactions, and the foreseen and unforeseen consequences of those interactions. The next chapters (in Part ii) attempt to make sense of the dynamics between actors, processes and interests, with the analysis focusing specifically on the relationship between government and citizens (individually or collectively). Our description of empirical reality in the Netherlands will help us understand the impact of digitization on that relationship. Before we begin our empirical analysis, however, this chapter offers an analytical framework. It also discusses the main issues and key concepts explored in the rest of the book. As stated previously, the analysis presented in this book focuses less on individual technologies than on the role these technologies play in the relationship between different actors. In other words, it studies the ‘sociotechnological complex’, and explores the interplay between technology and information from that perspective (Section 2.2). The chapter goes on to offer a descriptive and normative framework for charting empirical reality. The emphasis is on practical developments and actual shifts in the various actors’ positions, authority and influence. Section 2.3 defines the main actors: government, citizens and technological applications. Section 2.4 then introduces a normative framework for describing the dynamics of empirical reality. It divides the many different, widely varying principles (e.g. effi- ciency, transparency, and freedom of choice) that turn up again and again in policy proposals and public and political debate into three clusters – driving principles, underpinning principles, and process-based principles. The dynamics between these three clusters give us an important normative and analytical tool for identi- fying and explaining the empirical developments discussed in Part ii.', '48 i government 2.1 views on the relationship between technology and its users This book examines the impact of using ict on the relationship between govern- ment and the citizen. Anyone embarking on such an examination must first clarify precisely how the role and influence of technology are interpreted. Is technology – whether we mean a public transport chip card, biometrics, or a security camera – nothing more than a neutral tool wielded by citizens, politicians and policymak- ers? Or is it in fact an irresistible force that follows its own logic and, in doing so, also has its own separate impact? These questions touch on an academic debate about the conceptual interpretation of technology and the factors that can be emphasised when studying technology, society, and the interaction between them. Opinions expressed in the literature are by no means unanimous in this regard. Although our analysis does not do full justice to the wide-ranging academic debate about the nature and role of technology in society, we can basi- cally divide the views put forward in public debate and in political and administra- tive reality into three approaches. At one end of the spectrum is instrumentalism, and at the other there is technological determinism. The middle ground between these two extremes consists of a dense multidisciplinary field that is more constructivist in its approach. Because this study focuses on the relevant actors – the citizen, government, and the ‘application’ – and examines the interaction between social and technological influences, it can immediately be identified as constructivist. Before examining this middle ground in more detail, we will look more generally at the broader spectrum of viewpoints. After all, all three approaches are applied, more or less explicitly, in public debate. 2.1.1 from instrumentalism to technological determinism According to the principles of instrumentalism, technology is a neutral and valu- able tool that can be used in many different ways. Technological applications are the neutral bearers of their designers’ ideas and aims. Social change takes place autonomously and drives technology forward. In this view, technology offers an excellent solution to all kinds of problems; it is a multifunctional instrument (Kaplan 2009: xvi). As a result, politicians are quick to turn to technology to solve problems, including societal ones (see also Van den Berg et al. 2008). That is not to say that instrumentalists are convinced that technology will lead to good results every time. If the outcome is disappointing, it is the users who are to blame, and not the technology (Van de Donk & Depla 1993). That is because technology is regarded as value-free, a mere ‘instrument’ in the hands of those who can use it either for good or evil. Although the notion of technology as a neutral instrument has lost popularity in academic circles in recent decades, it is often still very much alive in government, according to recent reports by the Netherlands Court of Audit (Netherlands Court of Audit 2007; Edge 1995; MacKenzie 1999a: 43).', 'analytical framework: information, actors and principles 49 Box 2.1 Citizen Service Number (bsn): neutral instrument or force that follows its own logic? During the Dutch Parliament’s discussion of the bill introducing the Citizen Service Number (bsn), the Minister responsible stressed that this unique personal number was nothing more than an information number, suggesting that its consequences and impact would be neutral. The Confederation of Netherlands Industry and Employers (vno-ncw) agreed with this view unequivocally, stating: “Our overall comment is that the bsn does not pose a risk in itself. It is a neutral number. Any data-sharing that is prohibited without the bsn will also be prohibited with the bsn” (Position of vno-ncw in bsn discussion with the Data Protection Authority, 30 January 2006). However, various parliamentary parties in both the House of Representatives and the Senate noted that the bsn facilitated the ‘increasing informational power of government’ (Tweede Kamer 2005-2006c: 1). Concern was also expressed that the bsn would lead to both public and private-sector organisations changing their working methods and information requirements (Eerste Kamer 2007-2008). Since then, various cases have shown that the bsn is clearly more than just a neutral tool; it is developing into an appealing policy vehicle. Some examples: a bill is now being prepared to allow the bsn to be used in the financial sector (Eerste Kamer 2009-2010f); there was a heated discussion in mid-2010 between the Data Protection Authority, the Ministry of Infra- structure and the Environment about displaying the bsn on the Civil Service Smartcard (Rijkspas) (cbp 2010a); and the Ministry of Economic Affairs is investigating whether the bsn can be used for electronic authentication (‘eRecognition’) by companies and self-employed people who make use of digital service delivery (Leenes, Koops & Van der Wees 2010). The State Secretary at the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations stated in late August 2010 that she did not see any reason to draft an overarching evaluation framework for the use (or wider use) of the bsn (Eerste Kamer 2009-2010f). At that point, more than two years had passed since Parliament had asked the Government to indicate a feasible evaluation framework (Eerste Kamer 2007-2008). Technological determinism is based on the assumption that technology plays a crucial role in shaping society. Technology is depicted as an irresistible force that follows its own logic and has a major impact on the way work, the economy, and society as a whole are organised (Williams & Edge 1996: 55). As far back as 1996, Frissen concluded that the instrumentalist view of technology so prevalent in the modern pursuit of control had become almost untenable considering its autonomous power (Frissen 1996: 344). More recently, Socialist Party mp Ronald van Raak made the following comment at general parliamentary consultations on the national database of biometric features.', '50 i government “The tools will determine the morality. Imagine that such a database exists. A terrible crime is committed. The police naturally want to solve it. And if the option is available to them ... Create the database and you create a use for it. It is obvious that the database will be used for all kinds of other purposes in future. I’m sure the State Secretary is well aware of that” (Tweede Kamer 2010- 2011a: 15). There are various gradations of technological determinism. In the most extreme case, technology is reason enough for behaviour to change, and even for whole societies to be transformed (Chandler 1996). In the milder variety, technology is still the most decisive factor, but not the only one (MacKenzie 1999b)\n",

            "['10. A Glass Half Full... Australian women’s health activists, in their long quest for the changes that will improve women’s health—and the health of the whole population—have reason to feel both gratification and disappointment. For although they can lay claim to remarkable achievements, some of the most important goals are yet to be achieved. Moreover, along the way, crucially important opportunities for structural health reform have been missed. In the early days, movement members identified a set of problems, many of them rarely discussed in public, and then worked persistently until community attitudes shifted, decision makers took notice and policy responses were made. As a result, new laws and new programs to advance women’s health were devised and funded across the country. The movement itself set up an infrastructure of community-based healthcare centres and services to support women in their daily lives and at times of distress and crisis. This infrastructure serves as an institutional base for the movement, supporting intelligence gathering, information sharing, policy development and advocacy work. Taking up the health reform ideas of the 1970s and applying a gender lens, the concept of a social health perspective was developed and disseminated. Arguably, wider understanding and acceptance of the social view of health is the movement’s most important accomplishment. Unfamiliar in the early 1970s when the comprehensiveness of hospital and medical services was rarely questioned, the social perspective now explicitly informs most Commonwealth, State and Territory health policy documents. On the other side of the ledger, the women’s health sector has always been seriously under-funded, which has restricted its capacity to meet immediate needs and to develop innovative and collaborative health-promoting strategies. It also restricts its capacity to expand its constituency because, being thinly scattered, only a few women can have access to the services it provides. While the mainstream health system has responded to some aspects of the feminist critique, it remains heavily centred on the medical model, with its focus on treatment services. The best-practice models of preventive health care developed in the community sector have not yet had a system-wide impact, mostly because structural incentives steer provision in the direction of high-turnover treatment services. Health reform has been high on the national agenda since 2007, where policy documents recognise social determinants and talk about the importance of prevention. Yet proposals to strengthen primary health care—the locus of any significant preventative effort—have so far been restricted to supporting the services provided in general practitioners’ surgeries on a fee-for-service basis. The 1970s vision of a holistic, prevention-focused, primary healthcare system is still the stuff of dreams. 305', 'Reaching for Health Nevertheless, innovative models of practice continue to be developed in the small community-based worlds of women’s health, Aboriginal health and community health. The States and Territories, within the limited finance available to them, are generating innovative approaches to primary health care through partnerships and collaborations with the community sector and others. And after a small injection of extra funding that came with the Emergency Response, policymakers in the Northern Territory’s Aboriginal medical services are leading the way in Australian health reform, as the Aboriginal health movement led the way in the 1970s. This concluding chapter looks at the achievements of the women’s health movement and the goals that are still to be reached. It then examines the reasons that structural reform has been so hard to achieve, returning to the last question posed in the introduction: why, despite the wealth of evidence and the advocacy of women and other public health reformers, have the key structures of the health system remained virtually unchanged since the 1970s? Two Steps Forward At the local level, in female-run centres and services, women participate in health decision making, which is held to be the gold standard by health experts. The services provided are highly valued by those who use them, particularly by disadvantaged and marginalised women. Primary prevention undertakings, infrequently available in the hospital and medical systems, are tailored to meet local needs. Self-help is supported, health literacy is promoted and group programs are developed. Support and referral services and community- development projects are part of everyday practice, along with interaction and collaboration with local service providers. Currently, 65 community-based, feminist women’s health centres are providing services nationally, along with almost 400 refuges, shelters, safe houses and information and referral services for women escaping violence. Sexual assault services have been established in all States and Territories. Some are still independent and community based, others are government run, sometimes informed by feminist principles, sometimes with community representatives on their boards. There are approximately 150 community-controlled Aboriginal health centres, in which women play important roles. In addition, there are specialist centres, such as Children by Choice in Queensland, the Multicultural Centre for Women’s Health in Victoria and Aboriginal women’s health centres. Informed by a social perspective of health and illness, these organisations provide an extensive range of medical and non-medical services, tailored to respond to the expressed needs of the communities in which they are located. 306', '10 . A Glass Half Full... In women’s health centres, participation in health decision making is a daily reality. Clients are familiar with the concept of participation and they feel a sense of involvement with the centres they attend and a capacity to influence what happens there. Community women are often involved in centre management, and participation in the many group programs on offer opens the way for health development, empowerment, companionship, and the giving and receiving of support (Broom 1996:24–5, 1997:278). This is all the more valuable because women’s health centres serve a clientele that is markedly disadvantaged compared with the female population overall. Clients are significantly more likely to have been born overseas, to identify as being Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, to have lower education levels and below-average incomes, to have been unemployed in the past year, to be lone mothers and not to be buying their own homes (Broom 1997:277). These are the women who are least likely to participate in civil society and most likely to have poor health outcomes. Women’s health centres also undertake outreach work enabling them to make contact with women who might otherwise be excluded and whose needs often go unrecognised. Workers in women’s health centres are caring for women while at the same time assisting them to gain skills to care for themselves. And judging by the popularity of the centres, they are doing these jobs well. The number of women’s health advocacy groups continues to grow, supporting more women and drawing attention to an ever-broadening sweep of health issues. Professionals, including legal, law enforcement, allied health and medical professionals, have received training in feminist health perspectives and cultural competence. The latter now appears in the curriculums of some medical schools (Ambanpola 2005). Influenced by other social changes as well, the way women experience encounters with medical and hospital systems has shifted in response to the feminist critique. Professional attitudes are less patronising and judgmental and women’s health concerns are less likely to be trivialised. Finding a woman doctor, particularly a general practitioner, is likely to be easier, as women now enter medical training in much the same numbers as men. Raising public awareness of problems, such as the over-prescription of tranquillisers and the dangers of certain drugs, has resulted in increased health literacy and more careful practice. Following earlier overseas developments, moves are at last being initiated in Australia to ensure that appropriate numbers of women are included in research projects. The hundreds of refuges scattered across the country provide essential services for women and children, where previously there were almost none. Since the early days, when volunteers responded as best they could to the needs of the women and children landing on their doorsteps, feminist refuges have undertaken political advocacy as well as providing support services and crisis 307', 'Reaching for Health accommodation. As the expertise and professionalism of workers increased, the range of services was broadened and became increasingly sophisticated. Where budgets allow, refuges provide child care, children’s programs, child-protection services and programs to enhance parenting skills. They assist with legal and financial matters and with access to long-term housing. Counselling services are provided and families are assisted to deal with health issues. As well as advocacy and community education, refuges provide outreach and training. Staff regularly contribute to policy development and interact with a plethora of government and non-governmental agencies as part of efforts to coordinate complex sets of services (Gander and Champion 2009). Peak bodies, at both the sub-national and the national levels, support the sectors and act as a conduit to government. WESNET, the national peak body representing almost 400 agencies, identifies areas of unmet need, draws attention to new and emerging issues and stimulates debate within the sector through its newsletter and through forums and conferences. It lobbies governments to improve policies and expand services and undertakes research, including resear\n",

            "['Introduction Once upon a time, before the feminists carried their banners emblazoned with the women’s sign and the inscription ‘Women’s Liberation’, there was a luxury tax on the contraceptive pill. (Stevens 1995:13) When the women’s health movement burst onto the Australian political scene as part of the resurgent women’s movement, resentment about social arrangements was intense. Women knew how it felt to be trivialised, disbelieved and dismissed. They had experienced frustration, indignity and stigmatisation in their daily lives. For many, encounters with the health system were unsatisfactory and often humiliating and traumatising. In the early 1970s, the gatherings organised by mobilising feminists provided an opportunity for women to ventilate their concerns, often for the first time. The gender order would never be quite the same again. At a packed public ‘speak-out’ organised by Melbourne feminists in early 1973, poor health care and lack of relevant information emerged as the dominant concerns. Women told stories that shocked those listening, stories that were confirmed by the doctors, nurses and healthcare workers who were present. Women’s health care was condemned as too often ‘demeaning, discriminatory, judgemental and of poor quality’ (Hull 1986:14). Sydney women reached a similar verdict at another gathering a few weeks later. Unmarried women told of lectures that implied immorality and promiscuity when they requested contraceptives, which were often denied them, and married women talked about the difficulties and the humiliation of requesting an abortion. Older women reported being unable to get information about menopause and of being summarily dismissed or referred to a psychiatrist. All women shared the distress they felt at being made to feel ‘dirty, shameful, unbalanced, neurotic, stupid and guilty’. Out of these meetings, the first dedicated women’s health groups were formed. The intention was to set up centres where skilled medical care would be available, where women could speak openly about their lives and share their experiences ‘in an atmosphere of warmth, acceptance and understanding’ (Cooper and Spencer 1978:149). Feminists, as well as feeling anger about their encounters with the health system, objected strongly to the entrenched gender order. From the ‘best’ clubs to local pubs, women were frequently excluded from sporting and social venues. The bar obliging married women to resign from permanent jobs in the Public Service had been lifted in 1966 but women were still largely absent from public- sector life. Domestic violence, rape and child sexual abuse were not discussed openly. A feminist-produced sex education pamphlet for young women was branded ‘obscene’ by major newspapers in 1971 and abortion-squad detectives 1', 'Reaching for Health carried out investigations at Sydney girls’ schools, even though the brochure had been approved by parents’ and citizens’ associations (Stevens 1995:14–15). Sanitary pads were wrapped in brown paper and hidden under pharmacy counters and women’s sexuality was still depicted in Australian obstetrical and gynaecological textbooks from a heterosexual perspective with women’s natural aspirations portrayed as marriage and mothering (Koutroulis 1990). There were few publicly funded support services for women or anyone else who needed them. After more than 20 years of conservative national government, the Australian welfare system was in a primordial state, having missed out on most of the expansion that had taken place in comparable countries after World War II (Gray 2003; Jones 1990:29–48). The hospital and medical system was sorely in need of reform; financial barriers to access were high and the range of services was narrow (Gray 1984, 1991; Sax 1984). Aboriginal communities and Aboriginal health were ravaged by the combined impacts of colonisation, racism and government policies. Despite high immigration rates in the 1950s and 1960s, services for newly arrived people were scarce. It was extremely difficult to find an interpreter, for example, even in the largest hospitals in the country. There was no public income support for single parents, and about 80 per cent of court orders for family maintenance were never honoured. Only the wealthy could afford child care. Some lone mothers, who needed paid work to survive, took small children with them to early morning cleaning jobs. Others left them at home to take themselves to school, sometimes hours before the starting bell. It was in this context that the embryonic women’s health movement made its first faltering efforts to respond to the calls for help that were being made. As one participant remembers the early situation: ‘the phone calls and letters were coming in from women everywhere...They desperately needed information on abortion, contraception, and many other things that were affecting their health so badly. And we didn’t know the answers!’ (Zelda D’Aprano, quoted in Robertson n.d.:Ch. 16). With few resources and, in many cases, very little knowledge about politics or medical care, small groups of women set out not only to provide health services but also to achieve fundamental social change and public policy transformation. From the beginning, they knew that many of the circumstances of women’s lives, not least their second-class status, had a detrimental impact on their health and needed to be changed. They articulated the problems arising from gender roles, identified domestic violence as a serious women’s health issue and broke the silence surrounding sexual assault. Where they found glaring gaps in the services available they tried to fill them by establishing services themselves: health centres, sexual assault services and refuges for women and children who had nowhere to go were set up on precarious foundations. They set up telephone help lines to provide information and support. They took to the streets to fight 2', 'Introduction for a woman’s right to choose a safe abortion and they campaigned on factory floors and within the union movement to modernise occupational health and safety regimes. Mothers’ groups agitated for women’s control of childbirth and to achieve maternity-care reform. Feminist-inspired training modules for the police, the judiciary and other relevant professions were developed, so that sexual assault and violence services might be delivered more appropriately. Healthcare providers were trained and educated about feminist health perspectives. The underlying philosophy was to provide services and support ‘by women, for women’. Critiques of the social, political and economic organisation of society were developed, along with strategies for how to promote change. In carrying out this work, women faced huge obstacles, particularly a shortage of resources of all kinds. As time went on, it became increasingly clear that the structural forces supporting the existing system were not going to be dislodged easily. In health, the power of organised medicine was brought to bear against every reform proposal, while pharmaceutical giants continued to peddle their wares. Bureaucracies—not accustomed to being challenged and comfortable with longstanding structures and practices—resisted new ideas, especially the notion that there should be separate women’s services. In the cultural sphere, ideas proved to be durable, especially discourses around domestic violence and rape. And when women suggested changes that would improve their economic position, the power of business and its acolytes mobilised against them. Whether it was community- based child care, national superannuation or paid maternity leave, the arguments against were that markets do a better job and are cheaper for the public purse. The political environment of the very early years was, however, a rare moment—one that was unusually favourable for the articulation of radical change proposals. Radical Reform on the Radar: The context of the early women’s health movement In public policy terms, the context in which proposals are developed has a strong impact on outcomes. Some political contexts facilitate change while others retard it. The environment in which the Australian women’s health movement emerged presented perhaps a ‘once in a lifetime’ policy opportunity. Internationally, change was in the air as radical challenges to the status quo were mounted in all Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. Equality-seeking social movements—interested in such issues as civil rights, 3', 'Reaching for Health peace, sexuality, the environment, self-help, and consumer, student, worker and women’s issues—were generating proposals for root-and-branch reform of existing power relations. In Australia, the health system was highly controversial. The publicly subsidised private health insurance system was inequitable, unpopular, complicated and expensive. Approximately 20 per cent of Australians had no health insurance coverage and hundreds of thousands had inadequate coverage. Frustration was widespread because the Liberal Coalition Government1—in power for more than 20 years—had failed to countenance reform except within the parameters of a private insurance regime. Competition between the major parties was intense as the Australian Labor Party (ALP), in opposition, developed a series of reform proposals that generated fierce public debates. Inside the ALP, opinions were divided between those who supported traditional Labor approaches to health, including a national, community-based medical service, staffed by salaried doctors, and those who supported the newer idea of universal health insurance. The former group opposed the entrenchment of the private fee-for-service medical practice that would come with national insurance because they thought it inimical to good health care. Many within the party, therefore, viewed health insurance as a transitional measure, a step along the way to a comprehensive \n",

Historiographical directions', '', '1. ‘Voluntarism’ in English health and welfare: visions of history Martin Gorsky Introduction In fact, the idea of an opposition between civil society and the state was formulated in a given context and in response to a precise intention: some liberal economists proposed it at the end of the eighteenth century to limit the sphere of action of the state, civil society being conceived of as the locus of an autonomous economic process. This was a quasi-polemical concept, opposed to administrative options of states of that era so that a certain kind of liberalism could flourish. But something bothers me even more: the reference to this antagonistic pair is never exempt from a sort of Manicheism, afflicting the notion of the state with a pejorative connotation at the same time as it idealizes society as something good, lively and warm. What I am attentive to is the fact that all human relationships are to a certain degree relationships of power. We evolve in a world of perpetual strategic relations. All power relations are not bad in and of themselves, but it is a fact that they always entail certain risks. M. Foucault, ‘The risks of security’1 This essay presents some reflections on historical writing about voluntarism and healthcare in Britain, one of the themes of this book. It begins, though, with a lengthy extract from Foucault, uttered in an interview concerning the welfare state, for the challenge it poses the reader approaching voluntarism in history. Its date is 1983, just when the power of the Communist bloc was starting to fray before the defiance of the Polish Solidarity movement. Coinciding with the Western turn to neo-liberal thought, the moment marked a revival of interest in civil society, conceived as a realm of activity lying between state and market whose work was essential to a thriving democracy. Although Foucault did not live to see this discussion play out, his comment raises a salutary doubt. To what extent is this, and by implication cognate terms like ‘voluntarism’, ‘third sector’, philanthropy’, 1 M. Foucault, ‘The risks of security’, in M. Foucault, Power, ed. J. Faubion (Essential Works of Foucault 1954–84, iii, 2002), pp. 365–81, at p. 372. 31', 'Healthcare in Ireland and Britain from 1850 a descriptor of a discernible social reality, and to what extent a figure of speech which conditions our perception of the world? The contemporary deployment of such language as political instrument has recently been amply illustrated through the ‘Big Society’ slogan, marshalled by the U.K. Conservative Party during the 2010 general election. With a philosophical lineage in Burkean Toryism, the underlying idea represented a route out of the post-crash ideological dilemma.2 If both the over-mighty state and hard-nosed Thatcherism had failed, then perhaps mobilizing the little platoons to rekindle civil society was a way forward? Although the ‘Big Society’ swiftly joined the pundits’ roll call of ‘big ideas that failed’, it was neither new nor transitory.3 Rather, the episode represented just the latest recrudescence of a political theme discernible since the nineteen-eighties. This was the period in which government first turned to the third sector to help it roll back the state, initially in areas like social housing and community job creation, then through establishing contractual and regulatory frameworks for the purchase of social services.4 The Blairite Third Way continued the process, plotting its rhetorical course between leaden bureaucracy and amoral markets. Now the voluntary sector’s hitherto supplementary role was formalized into one of partnership with the state, including an Office of the Third Sector within the Cabinet Office.5 Thus while ‘Big Society’ enthusiasms generated some distinctive policies the march towards welfare pluralism was long underway.6 Visions of history have played a part in the discourse accompanying these developments. Margaret Thatcher rooted her claim for voluntarism as ‘one of freedom’s greatest safeguards’ in a remembered past of small town Rotarians and the Women’s Royal Voluntary Service.7 Neo-liberal and leftist commentators alike invoked nineteenth-century friendly societies and co- operatives to demonstrate that individual self-interest was compatible with 2 J.

Finlayson, Citizen, State and Social Welfare in Britain (Oxford, 1994), p. 275). 32', '‘Voluntarism’ in English health and welfare collective goals.8 The nineteen-nineties briefly saw a ‘stakeholder welfare’ ideal, when a revived mutual aid movement was touted as the solution for low-income savers.9 Another bulwark of Victorian civic action, the voluntary hospital, was sometimes recalled in aid of the present, an appeal to pre-war achievement legitimizing the policy of trust status for N.H.S. hospitals.10 And recently ‘Red’ Tories and ‘Blue’ Labour alike have implicated the disappearance of working-class mutualism in today’s welfare dependence and political passivity.11 Alongside these co-options in policy discourse has been a substantial rethinking of British welfare history, driven by the desire to emancipate the subject area from what Finlayson dubbed a ‘welfare state escalator’ approach.12 By this he intended an implicit teleology whereby pre-1945 social policies or institutions were interpreted in light of advance to the destination of state welfare. This particularly disadvantaged voluntary provision, which was understood through later perceptions of its failings rather than on its own terms.13 Histories badged as ‘origins’ or ‘evolution’ studies betrayed this mindset. Empirical comparisons of long-run issues like the social security of older people further problematized the notion of Attlee’s welfare state as a critical juncture presaging improvement.14 Feminist thought provided another spur to revision, with women’s philanthropy recovered from the condescension of patriarchy and revalued as a field of social action.15 What was needed was the replacement of linear narrative with notions of a ‘mixed economy’ of welfare, and a constantly ‘moving frontier’ between public, private and voluntary sectors. New outline texts duly reacted to these critiques, though not without complaint that earlier authors’ efforts had been caricatured: after all the 8 D.

Recent texts showcase the range of work the turn has stimulated, but also evince tensions in balancing the wish to inform with the need to correct historical misapprehensions, and without licence to challenge the organizing concept.18 So what exactly is the subject area? Readers will note that thus far descriptors like ‘voluntarism’ and ‘civil society’ have been blithely elided, it has been hinted that their historiography entwines with the political economy of welfare, and certain types of institution or association that may fall under the lens have been suggested. In what follows these themes will be developed further, beginning with a discussion of how ‘voluntarism’ and related terms emerged as categories of historical analysis. The essay will then consider trends in historical writing about British healthcare both outside and within the ‘voluntarism’ paradigm.

Each profile is produced by country experts in collaboration with an international editor. In order to facilitate comparisons between countries, the profiles are based on a template, which is revised periodically. The template provides detailed guidelines and specific questions, definitions and examples needed to compile a profile. A HiT seeks to provide relevant information to support policy-makers and analysis in the development of health systems. This can be used: • to learn in detail about different approaches to the organization, financing and delivery of health services and the role of the main actors in health systems; • to describe the institutional framework, process, content and implementation of health care reform programmes; • to highlight challenges and areas that require more in-depth analysis; • to provide a tool for the dissemination of information on health systems and the exchange of experiences between policy-makers and analysts in different countries implementing reform strategies; and • to assist other researchers in more in-depth comparative health policy analysis. Compiling the profiles poses a number of methodological problems. In many countries, there is relatively little information available on the health system and the impact of reforms. Because of the lack of a uniform data source, quantitative data on health services in Myanmar are based on a number of sources – the World Health Organization, United Nations Children’s Fund, The World Bank, Asian Development Bank, Central Statistical Office of the Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development, Myanmar Information Management Unit website, and other relevant sources considered applicable to Myanmar’s context. viii', 'The HiT profiles can be used to inform policy-makers about the experiences in other countries that may be relevant to their own national situation. They can also be used to inform comparative analyses of health systems. This series is an ongoing initiative and material is updated at regular intervals. In-between the complete renewals of a HiT, the APO has put in place a mechanism to update sections of the published HiTs, which are called the “Living HiTs” series. This approach of regularly updating a country’s HiT ensures its continued relevance to the member countries of the region. Comments and suggestions for the further development and improvement of the HiT series are most welcome and can be sent to apobservatory@wpro.who.int.

The health system can also be judged by its success stories: eradication of smallpox, elimination of leprosy, trachoma, poliomyelitis and iodine-deficiency disorders. The first in the series of reforms implemented since the 1990s was on improved access to essential medicines and the introduction of different financing mechanisms to recover and replenish the costs. Reforms in other health-financing mechanisms were added (e.g. Revolving Drug Fund, hospital trust funds, community cost sharing including exemption for the poor, and community donations) in all public hospitals. Some of these financing mechanisms continue today. Initially, these mechanisms aimed at ensuring continuous replenishment of essential medicines by mobilizing resources from households and communities in the face of insufficient government funding. Later the mechanisms were extended by introducing exemption for the poor and supporting them through other mechanisms like trust funds, to offer protection from financial risk. However, these interventions are not able to raise sufficient revenues to replenish the medicines, or to reduce the out- of-pocket expenses and financial burden of the poor. The work of the RHCs since the early 1970s has been focused on externally assisted programmes, concentrated in selected townships and only for specific programme priorities, such as tuberculosis, malaria and HIV, and reproductive health. Thus, those townships without any donor-supported programmes had to concentrate on their routine activities with little technical, financial or material support. With the low salary paid to health workers, the staff in these areas became off-hour private practitioners. Major improvements in the health status of the population are crucial for inclusive growth. Public budget allocation for health has increased considerably in the last few years. However, no relevant data are available on how much of this increase has resulted in significant improvement in equity and access to health services. Donor-coordination and fund-support mechanisms have evolved into integrated programme management with the principle of 135', 'Oneness in line with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, but more effort is needed. The challenges of Myanmar are to overcome the limitations of the past (e.g. low investment in rural health services), inadequate funding for expansion of universal health coverage, and possible use for health of the funds generated from revenue on extracting natural resources. New opportunities should also be explored for filling the fiscal spaces in the national budget, and for increasing investment in rural health facilities. 6.1 Analysis of recent reforms Since the 1950s, the health system of Myanmar has expanded, creating networks of public hospitals, rural and urban health centres, and sub- rural health centres throughout the country. Most of this growth occurred between the 1970s and 1990s, when Myanmar adopted the principles and strategies of Health for All (HFA) and primary health care (PHC), following the Alma Ata Declaration. This community-based policy had a great impact on health development, especially in the prevention and control of major communicable diseases, and reducing child and maternal mortality. Health development in Myanmar could also be judged from its success stories, such as eradication of smallpox, elimination of leprosy, trachoma, poliomyelitis, and iodine-deficiency disorders (Ko-Ko, Thaung & Soe-Aung, 2002). Myanmar received international recognition for its achievement in health development during the 1980s and 1990s. For example, the Ayadaw Township People’s Health Plan Committee received the Sasakawa Health Prize at the 39th World Health Assembly in May 1986 (Tin-U et al., 1988). The Township Committee executed a successful health development programme using HFA and PHC, with the aim of total socioeconomic development in Ayadaw, within a short period. The township has maintained its momentum of health and development (Than-Sein, 2012). The Department of Health (DOH) received the International LIGURIA Prize for technology development in health and nutrition for the Joint Nutrition Support Programme (JNSP) of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) in 1991 (WHO, 1992). The JNSP in Myanmar demonstrated that, despite lack of resources, improvement in child health and nutrition through PHC could be brought about for a large population over a short period of time and at low cost per capita. A few of health reforms started in the 1980s and 1990s, during the period of the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) and State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) (see section 2.1), had great impact on health status, access to services and widening health inequity.

            "['Abstract The predominantly public financed and managed health system in Bhutan has evolved and grown remarkably in the past five and a half decades. Health services are available through a three-tier structure, i.e. primary, secondary and tertiary levels. Traditional and allopathic medicine services are integrated and delivered under one roof. Village health workers play an important role as a bridge between health services and the community to promote health. Programmes are in place to address the public health challenges facing the country. Health services are free as enshrined in the Constitution of Bhutan. Therefore, government revenue is the predominant source of health financing. In 2014, the total health expenditure (THE) was 3.6% of the gross domestic product (GDP). Despite the difficult geographical terrain and dispersed population settlements, access to health services has improved remarkably. Bhutan is among the top global performers in gains in life expectancy in the past 40 years. The targets of MDGs 4 and 5 have been achieved and since 2010, immunization levels have been maintained over 95%. However, the country faces a triple burden of health challenges. While communicable diseases remain a substantial burden, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are increasing. A few other emerging, challenging issues are crime, substance dependence and suicide/other mental health problems. Health equity requires attention as disparities exist in access to and utilization of health services as well as in health outcomes between urban and rural areas, income levels, districts and between western, central and eastern regions. Variations in efficiency levels among different districts and health facilities highlight the potential for improvement in overall efficiency. Though there is good evidence of intersectoral action, it needs to be fostered further to close the existing equity gaps and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). xxiii', 'Preface The Health Systems in Transition (HiT) profiles are country-based reports that provide a detailed description of a health system, and of reform and policy initiatives in progress or under development in a specific country. Each profile is produced by country experts in collaboration with two international editors. To facilitate comparisons between countries, the profiles are based on a template, which is revised periodically. The template provides detailed guidelines and specific questions, definitions and examples needed to compile a profile. A HiT profile seeks to provide relevant information to support policy- makers and analysis in the development of health systems. This can be used: • to learn in detail about different approaches to the organization, financing and delivery of health services, and the role of the main actors in health systems; • to describe the institutional framework, process, content and implementation of health-care reform programmes; • to highlight challenges and areas that require more in-depth analysis; • to provide a tool for the dissemination of information on health systems and the exchange of experiences between policy-makers and analysts in different countries implementing reform strategies; and • to assist other researchers in more in-depth comparative health policy analysis. Compiling the profiles poses a number of methodological issues. In many countries, there is relatively little information available on the health system and the impact of reforms. Due to the lack of a uniform data source, quantitative data on health services is based on a number of different sources, including the World Health Organization (WHO), national statistical offices, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) health data, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and any other sources considered useful by the xi', 'authors. Data collection methods and definitions sometimes vary, but typically are consistent within each separate series. The HiT profiles can be used to inform policy-makers about the experiences in other countries that may be relevant to their own national situation. They can also be used to inform comparative analyses of health systems. This series is an ongoing initiative, and the material will be updated at regular intervals. Comments and suggestions for further development and improvement of the HiT series are most welcome and can be sent to the apobservatory@ who.int.

Printed in India ii', '2 Governance Chapter summary This chapter provides the structure of the health system in Bhutan. It describes the emergence of modern medicines, which is currently integrated with the traditional medicine services. The provision of health services to the Bhutanese population involves the government, NGOs, private sector and development partners. However, as per section 21 of Article 9 of the Constitution, the government is mandated to provide “...free access to basic public health services in both modern and traditional medicines”. Therefore, the government health sector plays a dominant role over other players in providing health services to the people. The Ministry of Health (MoH) is responsible for policy formulation, health planning, policy implementation, monitoring and supervision of services related to preventive, promotive, curative and rehabilitative services both in traditional and modern medicines. It also provides technical guidance to the district health management and ensures continued availability of medical and non-medical supplies and human resources. There are five departments under the MoH: Department of Public Health (DoPH), Department of Medical Services (DoMS), Department of Medical Supplies and Health Infrastructure (DoMSHI), Department of Traditional Medicine Services (DoTMS) and the Directorate Services. The Human Resource Division under the Secretariat is responsible for the supply of human resources through selection and recruitment processes. In line with the decentralization policy of t\n",

            "['Learning from the health scale up under the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) How global health moved towards the MDGs Working Paper October 27, 2019 Guido Schmidt-Traub Executive Director Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), France Abstract The health sector has mounted the most coordinated, sophisticated, and ultimately successful campaigns and partnerships to pursue the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). As part of a global partnership without central coordination, global and national organizations collaborated in pursuit of the goals. This paper identifies five components of this global partnership: (i) shared goals and metrics, (ii) back-castings and policy standards, (iii) international funding mechanisms and national implementation, (iv) evidence-based advocacy, and (v) a strong evidence base, monitoring & evaluation, and technology development. Other priorities under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as education, smallholder farming, and access to basic infrastructure lack similar partnerships and organization. The paper proposes how, drawing on the experiences of the health sector, these sectors can strengthen their organization in pursuit of the SDGs. Just as happened in global health in the early 2000s, private philanthropy and development funders can help close implementation gaps that inhibit faster progress towards the SDGs. The author is grateful for advice and comments provided by Jeffrey D. Sachs, Chandrika Bahadur, Jessica Espey, Cecil Haverkamp, and John W. McArthur. The views expressed in this working paper may not represent the views of the SDSN or its Leadership Council. 1', 'About the SDSN The UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) mobilizes scientific and technical expertise from academia, civil society, and the private sector to support practical problem solving for sustainable development at local, national, and global scales. The SDSN has been operating since 2012 under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General. The SDSN is building national and regional networks of knowledge institutions, solution-focused thematic networks, and the SDG Academy, an online university for sustainable development. 2', 'MDGs (Kassebaum et al., 2014), nutrition (Bhutta et al., 2013), or achieve health convergence by 2035 (Jamison et al., 2013). These commissions played a central role in synthesizing and documenting the evidence base for how complex goals could be achieved in different country settings. Due to the high impact factor of The Lancet, large numbers of leading researchers and professionals trained their sights on tackling the implementation challenges for achieving the MDGs. Other partnerships were created to tackle specific implementation challenges. For example, the Stop TB Partnership standardized DOTS treatment protocols for application around the world and enlisted private industry to tackle the challenges of multi-drug-resistant TB (Stop TB Partnership, 2000). UNICEF, UNFPA, and many others have promoted essential child health packages, defined the core interventions for sexual and reproductive health, as well as maternal and newborn health. These global efforts to inventory tools, standardize treatment protocols, and establish global standards enabled an unprecedented diffusion of knowledge and technologies in a short period of time. Another driver for implementation research was funding from the Global Fund for program evaluation. This enabled researchers to test the efficacy of interventions and programs at national scales. For example, implementation research from a Global Fund-supported program in Kenya helped shape the global consensus for the need to distribute LINs for free or at highly subsidized prices (WHO, 2007b). Similarly, changes in treatment guidelines for HIV/AIDS were informed by implementation research from Global Fund-supported programs in Africa and elsewhere (WHO, 2016). Finally, the back-castings for health goals and lessons from implementation research revealed a number of technology gaps that the health sector then set out to fill. For example, in response to growing resistance to quinine, ACT was developed in a short period of time to reduce the risk of resistance to artemisinin, which had been developed by China. The fight against malaria also required simpler and faster diagnostic tools. With support from the Gates Foundation, major research and development efforts were launched that led to the introduction and adoption of new rapid diagnostic tests within a few years (Zhao et al., 2012). Industry developed low-cost production techniques for LINs and other medicines drawing on consensus lists of technology gaps (Kaplan et al., 2013). Throughout the Gates Foundation played a central role in identifying key technology gaps and promoting innovation through its generous funding to public-private partnerships for technology development. This includes bets on long-term technological breakthroughs, such as a malaria vaccine. 2. Lessons from the health partnership Starting in the early 2000s, the health sector has strengthened and expanded a global goal-based partnership that comprises many international and national organizations, which collaborate without central coordination or guidance. Without this ecosystem of organizations pursuing a shared global agenda, poor countries would not have experienced the rapid acceleration in improving health outcomes under the MDGs. While national governments bear the ultimate responsibility for achieving development objectives, the health experience suggests that a global partnership can play a critical role in meeting time-bound goals. The development community needs to consider how lessons from health might be applied to other sectors like education, water and sanitation, agriculture and food security, or energy access. Clearly, no 14', 'two sectors face the same challenges, but the five components of the global partnership for health provide a framework for identifying gaps and asking how a sector can accelerate progress towards the SDGs. Here is a list of key questions that other sectors might consider to identify priorities for consideration by governments, civil society, business, philanthropists, development finance institutions, and international organizations. 1. Shared goals and metrics: • Have broad international goals, such as the SDGs, been translated into transparent, medium-term targets shared by the entire sector? Are the responsible UN organizations, major civil society organizations, and other partners supporting these goals? • Are available metrics, such as the official SDG indicators, adequate for tracking progress towards the targets? If such metrics and/or supporting data do not exist, might an organization like the Gates-funded Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) be needed? 2. Back-castings and Policy Standards: • Does the sector have detailed global back-castings for how the international goals can be achieved, including a full analysis of financing needs? • Does the sector have a (formal or informal) mechanism for adopting global policy standards and guidance on implementation like the World Health Assembly? 3. Adequate Funding and National Implementation: • Does the sector have one or more funding mechanisms that can a. provide needs-based national-scale funding based on independent technical review, b. provide funding directly to government and other non-government organizations to promote innovation and effectiveness in different country settings, and c. promote independent evaluation and implementation research? 4. Evidence-based Advocacy: • Does the sector have independently funded advocacy organizations and watchdogs? • How can academics and other researchers be mobilized to work on how the goals can be achieved? 5. Applied Research, Monitoring & Evaluation and Technology Development: • Does the sector have a top-rated peer-reviewed journal like The Lancet or BMJ that publishes research on the effectiveness of interventions and cross-disciplinary research on how to achieve complex goals? • How can the sector support small-scale demonstration projects to test new interventions or delivery models? • How can the sector support the systematic evaluations of evidence on the efficacy of interventions? How can gaps in available technologies be identified and prioritized? Might the Cochrane Collaboration Group provide an organizational model? 15', '3. The example of education A highly preliminary application of these questions to education might reveal the following: As part of the SDGs, the education sector has committed to achieving universal secondary completion, but this goal lacks an operational definition. It is not clear whether the goal refers to upper or lower secondary completion. Equally importantly, the sector lacks clear mid-term goals for learning outcomes by field (e.g. literacy and numeracy) and level (e.g. pre-school, primary, lower and upper secondary). In the absence of such outcome standards, the sector is unable to pursue a goal-based approach. Closely, related, education also lacks a well-documented production function (Pritchett, 2013) and an evidence base that is as comprehensive and rigorous as in health. Recently, the RISE Program has been aiming to fill this gap (RISE, 2018). Critically, there is currently no equivalent in education for The Lancet or the BMJ that might foster a sustained applied research debate on how to achieve the SDG on education. So the sector is not building out and propagating the implementation knowledge that is required for a ‘delivery revolution’ along the lines of what the health sector experienced following the adoption of ‘3 by 5’. Meanwhile, the education sector has made some progress in improving outcome measures and collecting more data, but it remains far behind the health sector in terms of metrics and data availability. No consensus exists on what constitutes internationally comparable d\n",

Addressing NCDs in Asia through a health systems lens: Major challenges and the way forward Melisa Mei Jin Tan, Victoria Elizabeth Haldane, Sue-Anne Toh, Martin McKee, Helena Legido-Quigley 94', 'Addressing NCDs in Asia through a health systems lens: Major challenges and the way forward 3.1 Introduction NCDs pose a growing challenge to health and well-being in Asia and globally (WHO, 2016a). With an estimated population of over 4 billion, spanning more than 26 nations, Asia offers a diverse landscape to examine national responses to NCDs across a spectrum of political, economic, social and geographical settings. This wide spectrum of settings influences how health systems are funded and delivered. Every Asian country is in the midst of a demographic transition, albeit at different stages, but all characterized by population ageing; a trend that is expected to continue throughout Asia, with profound implications for the management of NCDs (UNESCAP, 2017). The situation is complicated by the scale and nature of ongoing internal and external migration within Asia, creating a dynamic transnational social landscape, including different types of migration, which challenges the ability of health systems to respond to the resulting changes in the burden of NCDs (IOM, 2010; Oyebode et al., 2015). Geography is another consideration. In this book, we define Asian countries as those so categorized by the United Nations (2017). They include fragmented archipelagos, vast plains and remote mountainous regions. However, all Asian governments face challenges in ensuring access to and continuity of NCD care in rural settings. Many have sought to strengthen primary health care (van Weel et al., 2016), while more ambitious ideas include the use of m-Health, with its purported potential to provide new ways to manage NCDs (Hegde et al., 2018; Ni et al., 2014; WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific, 2017a). At the same time, the growth of periurban areas and megacities in Asia, with mass migration from rural settings into cities, poses other challenges (IOM, 2014; UNESCO, 2018), particularly when combined with demographic transition (Khan et al., 2013). However, cities also offer opportunities for innovative strategies for NCDs through new thinking on urban planning and design (Singapore MoH, 2014). While geographical, economic and political contexts vary greatly across Asia, the immediate risk factors for NCDs are broadly similar everywhere, even if the burden of disease that they cause varies. This offers 95', 'opportunities for collaboration among Asian nations to develop approaches that are contextually appropriate. For example, the ASEAN, a grouping of ten member states working together to promote peace and stability in the South-East Asia region, has included NCDs as an exemplar of the need for regional cooperation (ASEAN, 2017) and has launched initiatives such as the ASEAN NCD Network, which seeks to bring together multiple sectors and stakeholders to address NCDs, including promotion of healthy lifestyles (ASEAN, 2017; Lim et al., 2014). This chapter presents an overview of the challenges and opportunities posed by NCDs in Asia and the responses adopted. It explores the diversity of factors of health systems and offers insights into the performance of health systems by exploring quality, people-centredness and resilience. This is illustrated by a series of case studies that exemplify the innovative approaches used across the region for the prevention, treatment and management of NCDs. 3.2 Overview and burden of NCDs in Asia NCDs are the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for 40.5 million deaths in 2016, 52% (21 million) of which occurred in the WHO South-East Asia and WHO Western Pacific regions. Additionally, significant reductions in DALYs due to NCDs for countries in the WHO South-East Asia and WHO Western Pacific regions have yet to occur (Fig. 3.1). DALYs in NCDs for the WHO Western Pacific Region, for example, contribute to at least 80% of all-cause DALYs (WHO, 2018). These numbers will continue to increase in the foreseeable future. The WHO South-East Asia Region has seen the number of deaths increase from 6.3 million NCD deaths in 2000 to 9.1 million NCD deaths in 2016, while the WHO Western Pacific Region has similarly seen a rise from 8.6 million to 11.9 million deaths (WHO, 2016b). Globally, four broad categories of NCDs account for the majority of NCD deaths – CVDs (17.5 million deaths), cancers (8.2 million deaths), respiratory diseases (including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]; 4 million deaths) and diabetes (1.5 million deaths) (WHO, 2014). Other important contributors to the burden of NCDs, particularly disability, including mental disorders, with an estimated 151.88 million cases of depression alone in the WHO Western Pacific and WHO South-East Asia regions (WHO, 2017a); and road traffic accidents and injuries, 96', 'Addressing NCDs in Asia through a health systems lens: Major challenges and the way forward responsible for the largest proportion of deaths in those aged 15–29 years in the WHO South-East Asia Region (WHO Regional Office for South-East Asia, 2015).

While some countries, such as Japan, the Republic of Korea and Singapore have seen decreasing death rates from CVDs, others, such as some Central Asian and South Asian nations, have either failed to reduce rates or, in some cases, have seen increases (Ohira and Iso, 2013). There has also been a significant reduction in DALYs due to CVDs by close to half over the past decades in countries such as the Republic of Korea (Fig. 3.2). Even where age-specific death rates are falling, the number of cases is often increasing because of population growth and ageing. 97 DALYs per 100 000 Thousands 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016', 'Fig. 3.2 DALYs per 100 000 due to CVDs for selected countries of the WHO South-East Asia and WHO Western Pacific regions, 1990– 2016 Cardiovascular diseases (both sexes, all ages) 6 5 4 3 2 Year India Philippines Sri Lanka Thailand Malaysia Indonesia Cambodia China Japan Nepal Singapore South Korea Source: Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, 2018 The burden of CVDs in a population reflects a range of proximate and distal risk factors. Among the former, hypertension is one of the commonest, yet easily treatable. Comparable data on risk factors and outcomes among those aged 35–70 years are available in several Asian countries from the Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study. Table 3.1 shows the prevalence of hypertension (blood pressure more than 140/90 mmHg or on treatment) in participants in the PURE study (Palafox et al., 2016). Among those who have experienced a CVD event, the risk of recurrence can be reduced by medicines for secondary prevention. Again, the PURE study has revealed levels that are suboptimal. Thus, among those who have experienced an event, a relatively small proportion were taking three or more of the recommended four classes of medications. In Asia, the percentages were as follows: Bangladesh (1.3%); China (0.9%); India (2.5%); Iran (19.2%); Malaysia (7.6%); Pakistan (0.8%)\n",

As you probably know... it’s very, very hard to find clear, reliable information about AIDS, although its availability is increasing. And it’s especially difficult—needless to say—to assemble coherent, trust- worthy material about women and the disease. But with this issue we’d like to make a commitment to offering you monthly as much of that material as we can gather, and to letting you know about other sources for it (such as an article by Laurie Sherman that will ap- pear in a mid-July issue of Gay Com- munity News, a leader in AIDS coverage). As we work to carry out this com- mitment, we feel lucky to have with us here in Boston not only GCN, but also the stunningly hard-working AIDS Ac- tion Committee and Fenway Com- munity Health Center, national leaders themselves in AIDS consciousness- and fundraising. And we’d like to invite all Of you, as well, to be a resource for us: as the women pasting up this issue gathered around the ‘safer sex guidelines” on page 14, we realized that there were as many reactions and interpretations as readers. So, in the tradition of past ‘reader speakouts,” we want to urge you to write us with your thoughts and feelings about AIDS. At the risk of sounding like a points to get things going. Has AIDS, in reality or prospect, changed your. life? How? What do you think will be its impact on our society? Why? We’d very much like to hear from you, at any length, on these or any other topics that interest you. R ta Those of you... ; who are relatively new to Soj may worry from the ad below that we'll : soon be `staffless. You longer-term s will probably readers, however, recognize this as one of our periodic ` major-turnover phases, in which we celebrate the overworked, underpaid women who’ve done so much to keep the paper going and welcome new energy. Don’t worry—we’ll soon be in- troducing new Sojettes in this space (especially if you take an interest in one : of the openings yourself)... . Do not miss (or is that “ms.”) A . the benefit reading that Adrienne ` Rich (!) will be giving for So/ and the Boston Women’s Fund on September '11 (at that now-traditional feminist reading site, Harvard’s Sanders Theatre).

Notes Happy New Year from the women of Soj!. We hope to bring you some exciting papers this year, including the best in feminist fiction, and poetry, incisive reviews of books, films, theater, and music, local and national news, and features that explore the diversity of women’s lives and feminist activism throughout the world. Just to whet your appetite, here-are a few upcoming features: women in China, the Philip- pines, and Argentina; the spread of AIDS among women in Africa; an interview with members of Chicago’s Jane collec- tive, a group of women who provided il- legal abortions in the late ’60s and ear- ly 70s; and an. exploration of lesbian families and communities. (Just a few more incentives to subscribe, if you don’t already! You wouldn’t want to miss any . of this, would you?) our final offer . .…. We want to make onè last offer to those of you who thought you’d finally escaped the holiday season. Forget to send Auntie Emmie a gift this season? Don’t fret! Soj will continue to offer half- price (that’s right just $7.50) gift subscriptions through January 31, 1988. No fuss, no muss—just fill out the back cover of this issue and we’ll do the rest (we even send a card for you). Speaking of gifts, we want to express our thanks to;all of you who have become Friends of Soj in the last two months. If you haven’t yet had a chance to consider this opportunity—well, don’t be the last on your block! Make an an- nual contribution of $100 or more (either in one lump :sum or quarterly in- stallments, see page.5), and you will receive our undying gratitude as well as „some special opportunities that we only offer to our Friends. You’ll get to give away free subs to two of your lucky friends, and we’ll send you one of our new t-shirts, as soon as they’re available. Not only are:we happier now that we have some Friends but we expect our lives to improve immensely over the next month with the'arrival of our new com- puters. Many thanks to all of you who _ have donated equipment! We are over- _ joyed at the prospect of setting up an online index of back issues of Soj; word processing letters, notes, and memos; and analyzing all those statistics about subscribers, advertisers, distributors, etc. statistics and all that stuff . .. Some of you are probably expecting our reader survey with this issue—sorry to disappoint you, but we promise to have it out in January. We really do want to know more about you, but we’ve been somewhat overwhelmed by our new jobs. . . . We do want you to know that we’ve greatly appreciated all the supportive let- ters and the comments on recent issues. Feedback is always welcome, in whatever form. Keep sending those let- ters and viewpoints—debate is what keeps Soj alive. comings and goings ... We are sad to announce the depar- tures of Ann Froines and Madge Kaplan from the Soj Board and staff respectively. Over the last tumultuous year, Ann has been well known as a voice of calm and also know you wouldn’t like it if it wasn’t reason for Soj’s Board of Directors. We will miss her at Board meetings, but we’re glad that she’s promised to stick around and help us think about archiving the back issues of Soj. (Those of you who have been to the office know that we are slowly being buried by twelve years of brilliant feminist writing.) Madge will be leaving her position as News Editor to follow her real love—radio broadcasting. Listen for her voice over the WBCN airwaves. . . News editor Ann Holder will be joined by Judy Andler, former staffperson for the Boston Les- bian and Gay March on Washington of- fice. Judy also works for the Massachusetts Coalition for Batff®red Women’s Shelters. We know that she’ll make a great contribution to Soj. what’s missing ... If you were disappointed last month because you didn’t see the fourth in our series of articles from women of different generations, look again. ...It’strue, we forgot the introduction, but Patty Hnatiuk wrote a wonderful piece on her many years as a day-care worker. She represented the forties, which means we’re into the fifties and just about half way through (unless you know some 110-year-old feminists out there.) You won’t find an article this month, but look for Phyllis Glazer in- the next issue. Let us, know if you’ve enjoyed these first-person accounts and if there are other com- munities of women out there you’d like to hear from: i : If you've been missing the Boston Resource Guide, don’t fret—it will return with the February issue. We know many of you rely on this handy guide (but we “ up-to-date). Hang on, it will be back! in this issue ... : We may not have an ‘outreach’ piece, but. we have some ẹxciting features this month.

Soj moves to 380 Green Street, Cambridge, MA 02139, in August. (Our phone number is the still the same, thank goodness!) But, this is just a temporary home—we'll be moving again in early 1989 to the home of our dreams! A location so wonderful that it will make all this moving and packing worth- while. As soon as everyone’s signed on the dotted lines we’ll give the full story. Meanwhile, send us good energy for the move, and don’t panic if our phone service is out of commission for a few days. (We’ll be too exhausted to answer, anyway!) thanks to everyone ... August seems to be the time of turn- over at Soj—for many of us September is the time we move on to new things—the time we begin our ‘new years.” Many people who have been important to Soj over the last several years are taking their leave this fall, and we want to express our warmest thanks and wish the best of luck to all of them. First, we want to thank Laura Zimmerman. Laura has held many positions at Soj. Currently a poetry editor, she has also been-the paper’s associate editor, a board member, and just a long time supporter and friend. We’ll miss her very much, and hope she’ll continue to lend advice, historical knowledge, and a supportive hand in the future. We have other staff members to thank as well: Blake Walton and Liz Cummings. One-time office manager Blake Walton has been a part of our freelance layout team over the past year. She’s taken a full-time job in Ithaca, NewYork, however, and: no longer wåänts to commute fór produc- tion weekends. We’ll miss her, especially on Monday rmornings, when she did all our last minute corrections before we left for the printer. We can’t say enough thanks to our trusty typesetter, Liz Cummings. Liz has pampered our Editwriter, coaxed it through our worst days, and gotten Soj out on time every month. We don’t know where we'll ever find such a wiz of a typesetter again (especially one who can read mangled copy, spec ads, do design, etc., etc.). Liz has the fastest fingers this side of the Mississippi. We also want to thank some of our Board members who will be leaving: E. J. Graff, who was also an interim editor at the paper during 1987; Dawn Paul, who is the supreme raffle organizer and will be much missed on the fundraising committee; Bonnie Engelhardt, who has acted as staff FAREWELL TO: 143 Albany Street Cambridge, MA 02139 mediator and staff support in ways that we cannot begin to express Our gratitude for (fortunately, Bonnie is staying on the finance committee); and Jennifer Rose, whose commitment to the fundraising committee was much appreciated, even though her tenure at Soj was cut short by other com- mitments in her life. i Last, but certainly not least, we want to express special thanks to our office assistants Amy Constantikes and _ Rebecca Whisnant, both of whom showed up at the door to offer their help and found themselves spending more time at Soj than they ever thought possible, and our summer in- _ tern, Wendy Levin. We don’t know _ what we would have done without them; and we don’t know what we'll do without them this month. (Ellen, stop sobbing and let go of their ankles!) Rebecca and Amy have spent much of this year doing the most mun- _ dane, and yet extremely important, work of keeping the office going, whether by entering data into our trus ty computer, opening the mail, sending out tear sheets, doing deposits, or packaging newspapers for distribution or storage. And Wendy has lent her À £ hand as well, while also being a great help as an editorial and production _ assistant. All three of these able women have also shown the flexibility _ and bizarre sense of humor that is ab- _ solutely mandatory for working here at _ Soj, and they’ve done their share of keeping the rest of us amused and hap- _ py. (Amy, can you sing us one more chorus from West Side Story before you go? Or perhaps you and Rebecca can give one last humming concert with Ellen!) > Thank you everyone, once again. We’ve appreciated all your help, from the smallest to the largest contribu- g| t tions, and we hope you’ll-stay in'touch. £ $ r8 hi new positions . .. i i With everyone leaving, we have a , few job openings here at the paper.. If =- you are a typesetter and would like a steady freelance job, please check out our ad in Help Wanted this month. We’re also looking for a poetry editor. Although not a paid \n",

Boston and Worcester Post Offices: send address changes to SOJOURNER: THE WOMEN'S FORUM, 1050 Letters The Coalition for Choice Makes a Choice Dear Sojourner: Recent relations between a group of this article, and the Coalition for Choice leads us to question both the integrity and the legitimacy of the leadership of the women’s movement for reproductive rights, and indeed, the (white) women’s movement itself. In November, a group of women of color wrote to the Coalition for Choice (CFC) out of concern for the limited na- ture of a proposed 24-week amendment to the Massachusetts Constitution, which ‘would guarantee a woman’s right to abortion during the first 24 weeks of / pregnancy. We werė concerned about the implications of the narrow definition of reproductive rights, which excludes the major concerns and needs of poor wom- en who are disproportionately women of color. In this letter, we listed five main points of opposition: 1) a woman’s right >to complete control of her body is non- negotiable; 2) women who learn of their pregnancy late, who need considerable time to raise money for abortions, who are not believed when they say they are raped, who are ashamed to admit to be- ing victims of incest, will be penalized by a 24-week limitation on abortions; 3) the amendment might be further wa- tered down by the legislature (which we later leárned is not currently a threat); 4) polling which had been cited by the CFC as a reason for the amendment could be easily manipulated; 5) allocat- ing massive resources to a campaign that doesn’t address the full range of repro- ductive needs of women of color and poor women by linking them to larger health-care access and quality-of-life is- sues continues the historical split be- tween the mainstteam women’s move- ment and marginalized women. Finally, the women of color group asked that the amendment be revised or dropped. We offered to meet with the CFC to discuss the more diverse reproductive needs of women and how to develop a more in- clusive strategy for obtaining our rights. In the meeting with the CFC Steering Committee (Coalition SC) the Women of Color group explained that we were not there to be educated about abortion or the legal steps to a constitutional amendment. We wanted to begin a process by which women of color could participate in deter- mining an adequate strategy for the repro- ductive rights movement. During the course of the meeting we were treated with condescension, lectured, and dis- missed. For example, we were told that al- though women of color were not involved in the decision-making body (which is made up of white wòmen and one white man), statistics on women of color were women of color, including the authors of consulted. Coalition SC members lectured us about such obvious matters as the anti- choice Supreme Court and questioned whether we were indeed “the right women ‘of color” for them to listen to. Despite a fairly acrimonious meeting, we left with an agreement that the Coali- tion SC member organizations [Planned Parenthood, Mass. Choice, Mass. NOW, the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights, the Civil Liberties Union of Mas- sachusetts, and the League of Women … Voters] would meet wit\n",

So, why stand in line at the mall? comings and goings ...… After a very long search for a new associ- ate editor, we have made our decision. We are delighted to welcome Linda Wong to our staff. Linda is a graduate of Wesleyan University, where she majored in East Asian History and worked as coordinator of the Women’s Center. She has interned in the Boston area with the Asian American Resource Workshop and the Chinese Progressive Association and has worked with Sampan, Chinatown’s weekly newspa- per. Last summer, Linda interned at Sojourner. She then joined our fundraising committee and, eventually, our Board of Directors. We look forward to Linda joining us in the office, where we can have the benefit of her enthusiasm and boundless energy five days a week. Of course, new faces almost always mean that goodbyes are in order. We want to thank, from the bottom of our hearts, Becca Chase and Laura Briggs, who have each worked part-time over the last seven months to bring you the best in feminist news. Becca is an old-timer here at Soj—she has worked as a proofreader, assistant editor, and arts/theatre editor over the last four years, and we were more than happy to welcome her back as national news editor. We suspect this may be our last goodbye to Becca (as we hear she is headed for the Big Apple), and we’re truly sad to see her go. Laura, a new face just seven months ago, has become an integral member of the Sojourner staff. We’ve been challenged and excited by political discussions that Laura has initiated at all hours of the day and night, and we have been grateful for her willingness to do just about anything we have sent her way. Moreover, Laura’s exten- sive and insightful coverage of Boston area news has been a genuine plus for Sojourner. We wish Laura the best in her upcoming travels to the Dominican Republic. Also leaving her part-time duties is Christine Doherty. Christine has been work- ing as a fundraising assistant for the past six months, doing a variety of research and computer projects. You may remember that Christine was the volunteer publicity direc- tor for Sojourner’s fifteenth anniversary comedy event last March. She did a fabu- lous job (as shown by the sell-out crowd!), so we’re very happy that she’s agreed to work on upcoming fundraising projects. Thanks Christine—Monday mornings just haven’t been the same without you! This month we have to say a partial goodbye to board member Toni Schiff. Toni joined our personnel committee in the spring of 1989 and was elected to the board six months later. During this time, Toni has made enormous contributions to the work of developing good personnel policies and clear staff job descriptions—never an easy task. Her concern for the well-being of the staff and her commitment to an open pro- cess were always evident and will be missed. Although Toni is leaving the board, she will continue to coordinate the cassette recording of each month’s issue of the paper for distribution by Womyn’s Braille Press. Warmest thanks from all of us, Toni! We also want\n",

As you probably know... it’s very, very hard to find clear, reliable information about AIDS, although its availability is increasing. And it’s especially difficult—needless to say—to assemble coherent, trust- worthy material about women and the disease. But with this issue we’d like to make a commitment to offering you monthly as much of that material as we can gather, and to letting you know about other sources for it (such as an article by Laurie Sherman that will ap- pear in a mid-July issue of Gay Com- munity News, a leader in AIDS coverage). As we work to carry out this com- mitment, we feel lucky to have with us here in Boston not only GCN, but also the stunningly hard-working AIDS Ac- tion Committee and Fenway Com- munity Health Center, national leaders themselves in AIDS consciousness- and fundraising. And we’d like to invite all Of you, as well, to be a resource for us: as the women pasting up this issue gathered around the ‘safer sex guidelines” on page 14, we realized that there were as many reactions and interpretations as readers. So, in the tradition of past ‘reader speakouts,” we want to urge you to write us with your thoughts and feelings about AIDS. At the risk of sounding like a points to get things going. Has AIDS, in reality or prospect, changed your. life? How? What do you think will be its impact on our society? Why? We’d very much like to hear from you, at any length, on these or any other topics that interest you. R ta Those of you... ; who are relatively new to Soj may worry from the ad below that we'll : soon be `staffless. You longer-term s will probably readers, however, recognize this as one of our periodic ` major-turnover phases, in which we celebrate the overworked, underpaid women who’ve done so much to keep the paper going and welcome new energy. Don’t worry—we’ll soon be in- troducing new Sojettes in this space (especially if you take an interest in one : of the openings yourself)... . Do not miss (or is that “ms.”) A . the benefit reading that Adrienne ` Rich (!) will be giving for So/ and the Boston Women’s Fund on September '11 (at that now-traditional feminist reading site, Harvard’s Sanders Theatre). As you’d imagine, we’re tremendously excited about it—we’ll give you ticket info next month for what’s sure to be a sellout. SOJOURNER OPENINGS! position.

Notes We’ve been wondering . if you’ve been wondering about our search for new editors, which has lasted several months now. That is, we’re never sure how interesting Our in- ternal goings-on are to you; fascinating though they are to us. But to err on the side of disclosure (per feminist tradi- tion), we’d like to say a little about why our process has been so prolonged. There has been no shortage of ap- - plicantş; a number of wonderful women have materialized. The delay has stemmed more from our uncertain- ty about how best to distribute the workload here—So/ has grown tremen- dously since we last hired an editor in mid-1983. Because we could only af- ford to pay one editor then, her job responsibilities were easy to define (if not carry out): she did everything not done by the other two paid employees, the (overworked) full-time advertising manager and part-time office manager. Our growth has meant both that we can afford to hire mòre people and that we have to think much more carefully about staff structure, and it’s this ex- citing and demanding process that we’re now in the midst of (asking ourselves, for example, whether business-y responsibilities should fall to one person who would handle them alone, or should be distributed more generally). We’ll let you know what we think as soon as we know (and please keep those applications coming in the meantime)! Speaking of the meantime ... During this Processing Period, Soj has been ably edited by E.J. Graff (who remains interim editor) and by Pam Mitchell (who departed in March) and Ellen Herman (who left the editor- ship in April, but has agreed to bring _ her wit, warmth, and astuteness to our Board). People who deal with a work- load like this paper’s can never be thanked enough, but we want to be sure Ellen, Pam, and you know how much we appreciate the energy and talents they contributed during this transition period. But we haven’t been too busy . even at this hectic time to im- prove the paper’s design still further. This month’s stunning new Calendar ` ly transformed Soj from cover to cover ` ting ourselves (especially Office prompt arrival of the April and May and layout scheme are the work of Lin- da Bourke, whose brilliance has literal- in her two and a half years as Design Director.

And her storytelling skills have brought hilarity to many a Production Weekend—though we have yet to figure out whether alleged house- finches Frank and Arthur really exist.

Please know that the delay was (bar- ring commencement of a new ice age) an aberration, and that you'll again be receiving Soj in time to make those first-week Calendar events. Finally, we want to say that this would be a particularly good time (from our point of view, anyway) for you to let us know what you’re think- ing about us. We’d love a postcard tell- ing us your thoughts about this issue or any part thereof, a letter for publica- tion cheering/questioning something said in the`pages following, a View- point on an issue or experience that’s been much on your mind. You know: how it is: as we work on questions of structure here, we’re especially anxious to stay in close touch with the Outside World. So, as this issue makes its way from your mailbox to your couch and on into your kitchen and bathroom, we hope it moves you to drop us a line. We - need your feedback more than ever at times like this!

Reconstructing Life After the Tsunami: The work of Uplink Banda Aceh in Indonesia 1', 'gatekeeper137i aw 24/8/09 10:38 Page 2 Executive summary The global response to the 2004 tsunami that devastated coastal Asia was rapid; more funds were donated for this single disaster than for all others of this nature the entire previous year. But this flood of money and international aid has in fact made integrated reconstruc- tion a very difficult task. The NGO Uplink Banda Aceh (UBA) was established shortly after the tsunami largely destroyed the infrastructure and a large proportion of the population of Banda Aceh Province in Indonesia. This paper describes UBA’s work, which began with post-disaster emergency relief, but quickly moved into promoting and supporting community organisa- tions in a network of 23 villages as they tried to rebuild their lives. Banda Aceh has been described as being hit by two tsunamis; the second tsunami was the surge of unplanned, unregulated and unco-ordinated international aid that came pouring into the city shortly after the first tsunami struck, destroying existing social structures. Pressures on international donors to spend money, the belief that using contractors was the most effective way to construct housing, and an over-concentration on physical reconstruc- tion, have meant donor/aid organisations reconstructed villages according to their own specific agendas, undermining the social attitudes and structures of the surviving commu- nities in the process. UBA took on the challenge of helping these communities reassert their independence and sense of social cohesion. It began by ensuring people’s basic needs were being met, then organised people so they could start making their own decisions, planning their own communities, and reconstructing their lives (in every sense) according to their needs and priorities. This “reconstruction of life” approach means UBA uses housing and infrastruc- ture as the entry-points for building people’s capacity, for their participation, for trauma-healing, and for ensuring their self-determination and independence. Most international donors in the area avoided participatory forms of reconstruction, viewing them as slow, ineffective and of low quality. But by February 2007, UBA commu- nities had constructed over 3,300 houses (including infrastructure), while others, such as the Canadian Red Cross, had not yet completed a single house, despite a budget of US $300 million. The funding that poured into Banda Aceh and elsewhere did not eliminate poverty. UBA would like to see donors focus more on providing other forms of support, such as linking organisations together to allow them to share knowledge and experience. 2 gatekeeper 137i: August 2009', 'gatekeeper137i aw 24/8/09 10:38 Page 3 Reconstructing Life After the Tsunami: The work of Uplink Banda Aceh in Indonesia Ade Syukrizal, Wardah Hafidz, and Gabriela Sauter Introduction On December 26, 2004 an earthquake with an estimated seismic magnitude of 9.1-9.3 on the Richter scale caused a tsunami that claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands, destroyed villages and urban centres and affected livelihoods in many countries along the Indian Ocean, including Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka and India (Lay et al., 2005). The city district of Banda Aceh, on the western tip of Indonesia in the Indian Ocean, was the city nearest to the earthquake’s epicentre and was struck by a tsunami the height of a palm tree. In some of its kampungs (traditional villages), the survival rate was only 10%. The tsunami altered (and for the most part destroyed) the physical dimensions of Banda Aceh and its neighbouring villages—from houses, to landscape, infrastructure, hospitals, schools, and mosques. But in the words of Wardah Hafidz, director of the Urban Poor Consortium (UPC), “Banda Aceh is a story of two tsunamis”. The second tsunami relates to the destruction of social structures that entailed from the surge of unplanned, unregulated, and unco-ordinated international aid that came pouring into the city shortly after the first tsunami struck. Pressures on international donors to spend money, the belief that using contractors was the most effective way to construct housing, and an over-concentration on physical reconstruction, have meant donor/aid organisations reconstructed villages according to their own specific agendas, fundamentally changing the social attitudes and structures of the surviving communities in the process. The emergence of Uplink Banda Aceh In addition to the challenges described above, for safety reasons the government tried to enforce a 2-km no-build zone between the coast and new settlements against the wishes of the former coastal communities. It was this that gave Uplink (Box 1) its impetus to form a Banda Aceh chapter, and provided an entry point for the organisation Reconstructing Life After the Tsunami: The work of Uplink Banda Aceh in Indonesia 3', 'gatekeeper137i aw 24/8/09 10:38 Page 4 to facilitate the rebuilding of communities.1 Uplink Banda Aceh (UBA) was established shortly after the tsunami and took up the challenging task of seeking to reassert these communities’ independence and sense of social cohesion.

The Organisation of Rural Associations for Progress, Zimbabwe: Self-Reliance for Sustainability 1', 'gatekeeper137d aw 15/8/08 14:13 Page 2 Executive summary The Organisation of Rural Associations for Progress (ORAP) has worked in the Matabeleland region of Zimbabwe, one of the nation’s least developed regions, since 1980. It has sought to address poverty and rebuild this area after the destruction and under-devel- opment associated with the fight for independence. It works principally among rural communities—although its focus has expanded to urban areas as well. Its aim is development and poverty reduction through empowerment, participation and self-reliance and it seeks to achieve this through the establishment of various programmes such as micro-finance, education, food security, community grant-making, and water resource management. Rooted in cultural practices—family connections, hard work, music and song—ORAP’s approach has been to address poverty by reconnecting people and rebuilding the social fabric of communities, using the family as the base unit, and uniting these into groups at different levels (family, village, umbrella, association). ORAP sees community groups not only as executing bodies, but also as channels for dialogue on development initiatives, philosophy, and approaches. It also emphasises developing relationships with external agencies, not only as sources of funding, but also for learning, idea-sharing, and partnerships. Among the lessons learnt are the significance of respecting the wisdom and input of local community members, and including them as empowered members of boards, task groups, committees, etc. ORAP’s experience shows how in many cases, having local members lead planning processes can ensure the greatest success. ORAP has successfully established sustainable self-driven community groups and developed links with formal sectors of society. It has helped change people’s perceptions of poverty and development and has managed to keep its projects and programmes going, even where external funding has ceased. ORAP’s continued presence and work programme, despite the country’s economic crisis (from 1999 to date) and the withdrawal of many international NGOs and other organisations, demonstrate the sustainability of organisations that are locally-driven and rooted in the community. 2 gatekeeper 137d: August 2008', 'gatekeeper137d aw 15/8/08 14:13 Page 3 The Organisation of Rural Associations for Progress, Zimbabwe Self-reliance for sustainability Dumisani Nyoni Introduction Following Zimbabwe’s independence in 1980, internal ethnic-based conflict between rival political parties resulted in destruction and underdevelopment in the Matabeleland region. The Organisation of Rural Associations for Progress (ORAP) was founded in 1980 by a Zimbabwean woman, together with a group of socially dedicated Zimbabweans, as a welfare organisation that sought to rebuild this least developed region of Zimbabwe (Matabeleland and the Midlands), irrespective of the ethnicities of its population. For 28 years, ORAP has been mobilising people across communities to take charge of their development processes. Rooted in cultural practices—family connections, hard work, music and song—ORAP’s approach has been to eradicate poverty by reconnecting people and rebuilding the social fabric of communities. The organisation ORAP exists to fight poverty in all its forms, principally among the rural communities of Zimbabwe, by empowering people by facilitating their own development in their cultural contexts.With the growing phenomenon of urban poverty, ORAP will also respond in the same way to needs in the urban areas, as resources permit. Vision and philosophy ORAP envisions empowered grassroots communities of women, men and young people free from hunger and poverty. Its development philosophy is one of self-reliance and grassroots participation based on the premise that rural people are poor because they have been dispossessed of their traditional knowledge, language and way of life. Disadvantaged groups must draw up their own plans and uplift themselves, relying mainly on their own intellect and available resources. The Organisation of Rural Associations for Progress, Zimbabwe: Self-Reliance for Sustainability 3', 'gatekeeper137d aw 15/8/08 14:13 Page 4 The ORAP development philosophy is derived from values and principles rooted in the culture of the Ndebele people who occupy most of the areas where ORAP works. These values have been articulated in the Ndebele language and can be captured as “7 Zs and a Q”: Zenzele — do it yourself Zihluze — examine yourself Ziqoqe — mobilise yourself Zimisele — commit yourself Ziqhatshe — be self-employed Zimele — be self-reliant Ziqhenye — be proud of yourself Qogelela — save/invest The philosophy revolves around the core concept of Zenzele, which stems from the African saying Akusimuntu ongasimuntu walutho (“there is nobody who has no purpose”). Zenzele is thus a development process of self-discovery and self-mobilisation administered by the self—not solely for the benefit of self but also for the development of others. This concept guides and threads through all that ORAP does and is evident everywhere and anywhere ORAP operates. The basic belief infusing ORAP’s work is that a human being is the prime instrument for development and that this relatively untapped force should be empowered through mass consciousness and self-determination.The fulcrum of such a process is perceived to be the family, hence ORAP’s unique family approach to development. ORAP’s approach to devel- opment starts with self-examination of an individual who belongs to a family. In the rural Zimbabwean context, communities are made up by the coming together of families for any purpose—weddings, funerals, farming, politics, etc. In the Ndebele culture, this coming together also occurs for labour purposes, such as in agriculture, building and construction. The colonial era destroyed the core family structure in Zimbabwean communities. Families were separated as villages w\n",

With the onset of World War I, all commercial mining activities ceased, only to be re-established in the 1920s under the transition from German to British rule. The first major gold rush took place in 1922 in Lupa, Southwest Tanzania, in what is now the Mbeya region (Bryceson et al. 2014). While early sector development primarily involved European settlers, ASM mining began to emerge with the passing of the 1929 Mining Ordinance, which enabled Tanzanians to apply for mining and prospecting licences (ibid.). In 1938 there were an estimated 32,000 ASM miners in Tanzania, 73% of which worked around Lupa (Lemelle 1986). During this period, small-scale mining became prevalent in the southwest, with investments from the British administration focusing on the former German gold mines around what is today referred to as the Lake Victoria Gold Fields. But it was in the northwest of the country where many large commercial gold mines, and to a lesser extent diamonds, lead, mica, and salt mines, began to concentrate. By 1936, the Geita Mine had become the largest gold producing mine in East Africa (Roberts 1986). The mining sector collapsed during World War II as a result of labour and supply shortages and struggled to re-establish itself in the war’s aftermath (Chachage 1993). Only the Williamson Diamond Mine in Shinyanga region experienced rapid expansion during the 1950s. Soon after Tanzania’s independence in 1961, ASM was discouraged – it was viewed as incompatible with a modern mining economy. In 1967, as Tanzania began to centralise economic planning and pursue indigenisation policies, the state acquired 12 www.iied.org', 'Background majority shares in foreign-owned projects and restricted foreign property ownership (Bryceson et al. 2012). In 1972, the State Mining Company (STAMICO) was established to operate nationalised mines. But when Tanzania succumbed to structural adjustment program (SAP) reforms in 1987, mining legislation was gradually liberalised. This included privatisation of STAMICO mines and removal of restrictions on the buying and selling of minerals (Chachage 1993; Lange 2006). As part of broader economic reforms, the government enacted the National Investment Promotion and Protection Act in 1990, which prioritised mining investments and provided incentives and guarantees for mining investors (ibid.). These reforms restored investor confidence, leading to a rapid increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) in both mining and prospecting over the 1990s. By 1998, the mineral economy had attracted more than US$2.5 billion of investment, especially in the gold sector in Northwestern Tanzania (Bryceson et al. 2012). Due to low agricultural commodity prices and a changing government stance on ASM, many peasants began to embrace mining during the 1980s as a livelihood option in mineral-rich regions of the country as an alternative to agriculture (Bryceson et al. 2012). This resulted in a series of major gold and gemstone discoveries and a rapid expansion of ASM (Chachage 1993). During the SAP era in particular, the government began to appreciate the potential of the mining sector to promote broad-based growth. This led to the formulation of the Mining Policy in 1997 and the ratification of the Mining Act in 1998. While both the Policy and the Act were highly investor friendly, the government also sought to provide avenues for the more than 500,000 ASM miners at that time to be more productively integrated into the mineral economy and to formalise their claims (Fisher 2007). With the 1998 Mining Act, ASM miners were offered the same opportunities as large-scale investors to obtain prospecting and mining licences through claims referred to as Primary Prospecting Licences (PPL) and Primary Mining Licences (PML) (Jønsson and Fold 2009). The Act though did not differentiate between truly artisanal mining relying on rudimentary technologies and more modernised small-scale mining operations. Mining authorities had a limited capacity to inform ASM miners about their legal rights and to process PML applications, however. Consequently, they favoured applications from exploration and mining companies tied to speculative investment rather than livelihood generation (Moody 2007; Jønsson and Fold 2014). This enabled larger investors, both foreign and locally owned, to secure claims over large areas that were mined by ASM operators. The ensuing conflict is ongoing and unresolved, and was one of the reasons behind the establishment of the Presidential Mining Review Committee in 2007 tasked with examining options to better integrate ASM into the mineral economy and capture domestic value from large-scale commercial mining. This ultimately resulted in a new Mining Policy in 2009 and a new Mining Act in 2010. www.iied.org 13', 'The new face of informaliTy in The Tanzanian mineral economy Key provisions of the 2010 Mining Act include (Jønsson and Fold 2014): ●● Establishment of designated PML mining areas, ●● Decentralisation of PML applications to Zonal offices, ●● Extension of PML validity from 5 to 7 years (and abolishment of PPL), ●● Reserving PML and gemstone mining for Tanzanian citizens or corporate bodies only, ●● Confiscation of mining licences held for speculation, ●● Awarding licences on a ‘first come, first serve’ basis in cases of conflicting claims, ●● Buying and selling permits through dealer and brokering licences or export permits for commodities originating from licensed mines, ●● Increasing royalty payments (calculated according to gross revenue instead of ‘net back-value’), and ●● Enabling government to acquire direct stakes in future mining projects. Building on the 1998 Mining Act, the 2010 Mining Act provides for six types of licences that regulate mineral value chain activities.

With the entry into force of the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilisation (Nagoya Protocol) an opportunity has arisen for countries to design an access and benefit-sharing (ABS) framework. This can promote the commercialisation of biological resources (biotrade) and provide legal certainty and transparency for the transfer of genetic resources. Although most biotrade businesses follow the core principles of sustainable biodiversity, there is lack of clarity about the application of ABS policy frameworks on biotrade businesses. The Nagoya Protocol aims to clarify key concepts, define the scope of ABS, and stipulate the responsibilities of user and provider countries of genetic resources. As a party to the protocol, Namibia has started developing comprehensive ABS legislation by leveraging its existing administrative and regulatory frameworks. The challenge for Namibia is to find a mutually supportive interrelation between ABS and biotrade, where the implementation of ABS and the promotion of biotrade can go hand in hand. Experiences in other African countries illustrate that the implementation of ABS frameworks is not without its challenges. In South Africa, broader economic losses and further marginalisation of women and poor communities occurred when ABS regulations were applied to existing biotrade businesses. In order to avoid these kinds of unanticipated consequences, Namibia’s efforts to develop ABS legislation and set up institutional arrangements to support the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol require careful policy consideration. A significant step in the right direction is to understand the interface between biotrade and ABS, especially the positive interaction that should exist between the two, and to have an informed strategy that addresses this complex relationship. It is the objective of this exploratory study to offer an outline of the national policy context, the ABS development process and salient issues and the connections between biotrade and ABS in the era of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Nagoya Protocol.

There is a growing emphasis on the formalisation of the INP sector which consists of both biotrade (through which biological resources are locally and globally traded) and bioprospecting (which involves the systematic exploration of biological resources for commercially valuable products). In many developing countries, efforts to formalise the sector are based on principles of promoting ecological sustainability and social justice, and the goal of generating public revenues.1 The undermining of natural systems through inter alia deforestation and overexploitation, coupled with increasing population pressure and rising demand for commodities, has led to concerns about the sustainability of INP harvesting practices. Further concerns relate to questions of equity and the fairness of supply chains in relation to the countries and communities in which these INPs are sourced.2 In response to this, key aspects of INP commercialisation have been given formal recognition through a variety of international agreements and conventions, national legislative frameworks and standardised eco-labelling mechanisms.3 In light of the adoption of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 1993 and the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilisation (Nagoya Protocol) in 2010, several countries Despite implementing and regions are developing national legislative and policy measures for the sustainable and passing more use and conservation of INPs.

Achieving Growth and Security in the Northern Triangle of Central America | 5', 'DR helped to strengthen trade and investment between the region and the United States, and the value of trade with the region increased 37 percent from 2005 to 2010.13 For example, under a Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) government from 1989 to 2004, El Salvador demonstrated great economic progress. The government’s National Reconstruction Plan (NRP) of 1992 to 1997 culminated in El Salvador achieving investment- grade bond status in 1998.14 By the early 2000s, El Salvador outperformed Chile, Argentina, South Korea, and Germany on the Index of Economic Freedom, which measures 10 indicators including rule of law, government spending, and market openness.15 As a result, immigration from El Salvador to the United States was low, and the economy was strong and growing.16 Job creation drove growth, decreased emigration, and poverty fell from 40 percent of the population in 1996 to 20 percent in 2000.17 Regrettably, the ARENA party was voted out of power in 2009 in El Salvador because of cases of corruption. Add to that the financial crisis in 2008 and the election of two Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) governments, El Salvador’s economic growth has diminished, investment rating has fallen, and poverty rates and immigration to the United States have increased. The FMLN governments have gravitated toward Venezuela receiving subsidized oil until recently. The FMLN has been perceived as ineffectual on confronting the security situation. Guatemala and Honduras also both made progress in the 1990s, but later backslid into economic stagnation. After a peace agreement in 1996 that ended the 36-year-long civil war, Guatemala saw improvements in human rights and corruption, but also saw a decline in the standard of living for most citizens despite economic reforms.18 Honduras also struggled with human rights abuses during the 1990s, and was devastated by Hurricane Mitch in 1998.19 The Honduran government struggled to rebuild both infrastructure and citizens’ trust during the early 2000s. In 2005, President George Bush signed CAFTA, thereby creating a free-trade area among the United States, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. The Dominican Republic joined CAFTA negotiations in 2004, and the resulting agreement became known as CAFTA-DR.

Many Salvadorans fled to the United States during the Salvadoran Civil War, and beginning in the 1990s, marginalized Salvadoran youth living in the United States formed street gangs, most notably in Los Angeles. These gangs evolved into the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and 18th Street Gangs, two of the most extensive criminal networks in the region. Many of these gang members and others associated with their crimes were deported during the early 2000s, when the United States deported over 129,000 convicted criminals to Central America.21 In 2012 alone, the United States deported over 14,000 people to Honduras and to Guatemala on criminal grounds and 9,000 to El Salvador.22 The initial influx of criminals gave the gangs a foothold in all three countries. In Honduras, MS-13 and the 18th Street Gang recruit young people—even those under the age of 15.23 With Honduras’ low levels of formal-sector employment, some young people have no incentive to stay in school, making illicit activity an attractive option. There is less overall gang violence in Guatemala. The main reason given for leaving Guatemala is extreme poverty especially among its very large indigenous community. The urban areas have significant murder rates, but the poorest, rural areas have far lower rates of murder and violent crime. What gang activity there is linked more to individual acts of extortion and trafficking, rather than gangs like MS-13 and 18th Street active in Honduras and El Salvador.24 The prevention of violence should be a priority for donors, particularly as reintegrating former gang members into licit society has proven difficult; Chapter 5 explores the issue of reintegration. Currently, Northern Triangle police and military forces rely on imprisonment for those charged with gang-related crimes, but overcrowding has caused prison riots and further outbreaks of retaliatory gang violence.25 Prisons in Guatemala face serious 20 Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, “CAFTA-DR (Dominican Republic-Central America FTA),” https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/cafta-dr-dominican-republic-central-america-fta. 21 Daly, “The Deported L.A.

            "['233 8 a broader perspective: looking beyond aid Development aid can take the form of direct aid from one country to another. However, aid in this form will gradually decrease in importance in the years to come. As development questions become increasingly interwoven with broader global and regional issues, the focal point of development activities will also have to shift in the same direction. That shift does not have to be made too hastily. For a number of developing countries, bilateral aid is still of vital importance and can be useful under certain conditions. However, that applies to a decreasing number of countries. If the pace of development between 2004 and 2008 continues, by 2020 classical developing countries like Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya and even Chad will be middle-income countries, at least according to current methods of measurement. The fate of these countries will then depend less on what financial support individual donors still wish to give them and more on how they respond to the opportunities they find and take for themselves in a globalizing world. The question is how development issues can gradually be placed more and more in such a global perspective. Donors are still making heavy weather of this shift in focus, and most of them have not yet even reached the conclusion that it is neces- sary. This chapter describes how to achieve this change in three stages. The first is how more aid can be provided through multilateral channels, which offers greater opportunities to address development issues from a broad perspective. The second stage relates to how national and European policies in areas that do not belong to the classical development domain can devote serious attention to their impact on development-related issues. After addressing coherence for develop- ment, the third step is to examine how development issues fit within an approach based on international public goods. This also means examining the implications for global governance of the increasing need for coordination and strategic integra- tion of policies with cross-border consequences. 8.1 multilateral aid Addressing development issues in a way that goes beyond classical bilateral aid can first be achieved by placing aid in a multilateral context. That has a number of advantages, including less need for coordination, greater effectiveness, lower transaction costs for recipients and donors, but especially more opportunities to tackle issues from a broader perspective. We first examine the extent to which attention is devoted to the latter possibility. European Union Does the European Union perhaps offer an appropriate context within which to provide a framework for the aid provided by member states? Since the 1992 Treaty', '234 less pretension, more ambition of Maastricht, development aid has been the shared responsibility of the European Community and its member states, and there has been a European development policy alongside national development policies (Van Schaik & Maes 2008). Ten years ago, the British Minister for International Development, Clare Short, described the European Commission as the “worst development agency in the world”, but since then reforms of management and strategy have substantially increased the effectiveness of European aid (Barder et al. 2010). Only a little over 20 percent of eu aid passes through the European Commission, but through the contributions of its growing number of member states, the eu has become the second largest donor, after the World Bank, and the combined aid provided by the eu and its member states accounts for some 60 percent of the global development effort. In theory, the European Union could take on a prominent role. In the first place, this might take the form of coordination, by clustering the knowledge and finan- cial resources of the member states. There are limitations to such a role, as not all member states are leading donors, while some major donors – like Switzerland, Norway and Canada – are not members of the eu. At the same time, however, it is worthwhile exploring the opportunities that do exist. One good reason for assign- ing the eu this role is that, certainly in comparison with France and the United Kingdom, it is seen as ‘politically neutral’. More importantly, however, the eu intervenes in areas that are crucial to development, including migration and trade. The European Commission negotiates on behalf of the member states at the wto and conducts free trade negotiations with countries and regions, while migration policy is also increasingly becoming a Europe-wide issue. The eu possesses a wide range of instruments – loans and, more especially, grants – which make an inte- grated approach possible. However, there seems to be, as yet, little political will among the member states to attribute the eu a prominent role in development aid. In practice, rather than being an umbrella organization or a body that pursues a coherent policy, the eu has become much more an additional donor, contributing to the further fragmen- tation of aid. For the time being, it seems likely that the eu will play little more than a limited role in harmonizing and coordinating policy. Some progress, however, can be noted. At its 2974th External Relations Council Meeting on 17 November 2009, the European Council succeeded in agreeing, in an Opera- tional Framework on Aid Effectiveness, on a division of labour stating in which developing countries which of fourteen member states and the Commission should be lead facilitator or supporting facilitator. What will become of this in practice remains to be seen. Attempts to go further than this appear to enjoy the support largely of civil servants, and of the Commission, but rarely of the Euro- pean Council. Those attempts are by no means meaningless – on some points they go much further than agreements made within the dac, in which the most impor-', 'a broader perspective: looking beyond aid 235 tant donors are represented. The eu has, for example, published a number of inno- vative documents, including The European Consensus on Development in 2005, the Code of Conduct on Division of Labour in 2007, and comprehensive reports on policy coherence in 2007 and 2009. The impact of these documents is, however, limited, not only within the member states but within the eu itself. More inten- sive coordination between the European member states will take much longer, if for no other reason than differences in orientation: the new member states, for example, prefer to focus on Central Asia more than on Africa, partly because they want to reduce migration from that region, and also because their own recent history makes them familiar with what the countries in the region are currently experiencing. The Lisbon Treaty can give European foreign policy a new momentum, with a recognizable, politically responsible figure (the new High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs) and with its own offices in other countries (European External Action Services). What this is all going to mean, however, will only become clear in the next few years. Many fear that the eu will for the time being remain primarily a ‘large Switzerland’ when it comes to foreign policy, because Germany, France and the United Kingdom do not seem prepared to subordinate their own foreign policy to that of the European Union as a whole. The role of development policy in relation to classical foreign policy (security and trade) will also have to be specified in greater detail – some even fear that development aid will be used as a bribe to achieve foreign policy objectives. In the field of development cooperation, as in other areas, Europe remains for the time being largely a promise. There are, however, clear opportunities. First of all, knowledge, policy and instruments can be better coordinated, for example by creating a sort of European version of the World Bank, which would undoubtedly be called the Europe Bank. More than eight billion euros a year are already provided through EuropeAid, making the European Commission the second largest donor of humanitarian aid and the third largest of development aid. That expanded role is, however, not linked to a good knowledge infrastructure, like that of the World Bank, or to large-scale credit provision – that is the responsibil- ity of the European Investment Bank (eib), which primarily operates within Europe, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (ebrd), which focuses predominantly on the former Soviet States, and is distinct from the policy of EuropeAid. Combining and expanding these European banks offers considerable opportunities for creating a genuine European development policy. A next step could be to take serious steps towards adopting a coordinating role at the level of individual recipient countries. Combining the role of coordinator of member states’ policy with being the 28th donor is not workable and leads to much friction with other donors in recipient countries. Focus on its coordinating', '236 less pretension, more ambition role could be combined with a concentration on the themes and areas in which the eu clearly has added value, and which European citizens consider legitimate issues for the eu. In that respect, the eu still appears to have difficulties accepting the signals that European voters sent out en masse during the process of ratifying the Lisbon Treaty: that Europe should primarily focus on what the member states cannot do themselves. The eu development policy has for a number of years already favored what are considered ‘less political’ domains, such as infrastructure and regional economic development (Grimm et al. 2005). That trend should be continued, and the eu should specialize on issues with a regional (that is: supra-national) character. That means no interventions in healthcare or education, as many (perhaps too many) other donors and funds already do that, but making know-h\n",

Yet this apparently widespread new consensus is deceptive: behind the ringing declara- tions lie fundamental fissures over the value and application of these concepts. Understanding and addressing these divisions is crucial to ensuring that the four principles become fully embedded in international development work. An Incomplete Bridge • Accountability, transparency, participation, and inclusion represent vital embodiments of the opening to politics that occurred in development work in the 1990s. They bridge three distinct practitioner communities that emerged from this new direction—those focusing on governance, on democracy, and on human rights. • But consensus remains elusive. Democracy and human rights practitioners generally embrace an explicitly political understanding of the four concepts and fear technocratic or purely instrumentalist approaches. Governance specialists often follow a narrower approach, applying the core principles primarily to the quest for greater public sector effectiveness. • Aid providers frequently present the four concepts as a unified agenda. Yet in actual programming they may only pursue or prioritize selective parts of the set, engendering tensions among the different principles. Inconsistencies and Uncertainties • Shallow practice. Aid organizations often treat the four principles as pro- grammatic boxes to be ticked rather than fundamental elements of their work. Although these concepts evoke potentially transformative notions of citizen empowerment, they risk being reduced in practice to limited forms of citizen consultation or technocratic reforms that rely on simplistic theo- ries of developmental change. • Debates about the place of the principles. Many aid practitioners remain skeptical of treating accountability, transparency, participation, and inclu- sion as intrinsic to their conception of development. They worry that broad- ening the development agenda on normative grounds will dilute the core focus on poverty reduction and growth. 1', '2 | Accountability, Transparency, Participation, and Inclusion: A New Development Consensus? • Questions about impact. Evidence for the developmental impact of the four principles is limited and inconclusive to date. Uncertainty about their instrumental value is compounded by the unresolved broader debate over the relationship between governance and economic development. • Resistance on the recipient side. Many developing country governments have rhetorically embraced the value of accountability, transparency, participation, and inclusion and joined international initiatives aimed at furthering these principles. However, the political will to translate such commitments into substantive political reform is often lacking. Some gov- ernments remain fiercely opposed to incorporating these principles into the international development agenda, viewing them as entry points for illegitimate political meddling.', 'Introduction If you are an unfamiliar visitor to an organization engaged in international development assistance and unsure of the reception you will receive, there is a surefire way to win over your hosts: tell them you believe that four key prin- ciples are crucial for development—accountability, transparency, participation, and inclusion. Your hosts will almost certainly nod enthusiastically, and declare that their organization in fact prioritizes these very concepts as key tools in the larger battle to eradicate extreme poverty and achieve sustained development. This holds true no matter whether you are visiting a major bilateral or multi- lateral aid agency, a foreign ministry engaged in development work, a trans- national nongovernmental organization, a private foundation, or any other of the many groups that now make up the tremendously heterogeneous world of international development aid. These four concepts have become a ubiquitous feature of the policy state- ments of countless aid organizations over the past few years. For example, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s recent strategy on democracy, human rights, and governance frames “greater citizen participa- tion and inclusion, and more accountable institutions and leaders” as its pri- mary high-level objectives, arguing that this framework will help “empower reformers and citizens from the bottom up.”1 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Development Assistance Committee affirms that “there is growing consensus on the value of human rights principles— such as participation, non-discrimination and accountability—for good and sustainable development practice,” and defines effective states as “those that . . . have open, transparent, accountable and inclusive political institutions.”2 Similarly, in its 2007 Governance and Anti-Corruption Strategy, the World Bank asserts that “engaged local communities, a vibrant civil society, and a transparent flow of information . . . support poverty reduction by helping to hold governments accountable for delivering better services, creating jobs, and improving living standards.”3 The Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) goes as far as putting nondiscrimination, participation, openness and transparency, and accountability forward as fundamental principles that “must be applied consistently throughout Swedish aid.”4 The four concepts do not only exist in policy documents. They are at the heart of many recent high-profile initiatives, ranging from the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and the Open Government Partnership (OGP) to the World Bank’s Global Partnership for Social Accountability and the Making All Voices Count “grand challenge for development” funded by the 3', '4 | Accountability, Transparency, Participation, and Inclusion: A New Development Consensus?

Evan Ellis | 35', '', '9 | Chinese Military Engagement in the Region The Chinese military presence in Latin America is likely to grow significantly by 2050 in both size and scope. Consistent with China’s 2015 defense strategy white paper,78 the PLA’s global operations likely will expand to defend its commercial engagement.

Indeed, it is difficult to overstate the degree to which fighting and prevailing in a military conflict with the United States in Taiwan would fundamentally alter the posture and behavior of the Chinese military in Latin America. By 2050, Chinese military product companies such as NORINCO and China Shipbuilding Industrial Corporation (CSIC)83 likely will have competitive offerings in all leading weapons systems and significant experience in arms sales and support in Latin America and the Caribbean, including maintenance and training packages. 78.

The Future of Latin America and the Caribbean in the Context of the Rise of China | 26', 'Although Latin American militaries may complain about Chinese military goods and the quirks of training and support, by 2050 the region’s armed forces are likely to have many more PRC-built systems in their inventories than today, and likely more Chinese systems than U.S., Russian, or European. As one consequence of the ubiquity of Chinese platforms and equipment in the tables of organization and equipment (TOEs) of Latin American militaries by 2050, those militaries will have established a pattern and developed an operational and strategic need for sending workers to the PRC for operator, maintenance, and other technical training, as well as bringing PLA personnel or contracted trainers from Chinese military companies to the region for in-region training on the operation, maintenance, and support of Chinese systems. Indeed, the level of participation by Latin American military officers in Chinese institutions (and enlisted personnel in Chinese training and professional military education courses) is likely to be far greater than today, although the differences between Chinese and Western approaches will continue to be an obstacle to Chinese training and education by Latin American militaries. If there is a significant conflict in the region in which the PRC prevails, it will likely have the effect of fundamentally “re-branding” the Chinese military and changing calculations in the region about U.S. dominance. More Latin American and Caribbean countries will engage seriously with the PRC, buying its weapons systems and taking its training, as well as tempting it to act with more hubris. R.

Agriculture. By 2050, as a continuation of current Chinese acquisitions of agricultural technology and logistics companies, and the growing number of Chinese agricultural projects in the region,28 the agro-industrial giants that today dominate the business in Latin America (e.g., ADM, Bunge, Dreyfus and Cargill) are likely to be supplanted by Chinese counterparts such as China Oilseeds and Foodstuffs Corporation (COFCO). By leveraging control over the world’s largest agricultural market, through the tools of regulation and phytosanitary certification, China likely will force Latin American companies to partner with PRC-based firms to obtain access to agricultural technology. China may also impose other conditions that advance the position of its companies, in the name of the strategic objective of food security. From a Latin American perspective, these trends imply that although Brazil and Argentina will increasingly supply basic agricultural goods to China, PRC-based firms largely will control such production, loaning money to and contracting with local farmers. Micro- lending for seeds and fertilizer, the purchase and consolidation of crops at harvest time and their processing (e.g., the crushing of soybeans) and transportation, likely will occur principally through local partners. For political reasons, with few exceptions Latin Americans rather than Chinese will continue to own most of the land in most countries.

Chinese economic reform and development: achievements, emerging challenges and unfinished tasks Jane Golley and Ligang Song The economic transformation that has taken place in China since the late 1970s is now regarded as one of the most significant social changes in human history. Within just three decades, China has succeeded in transforming itself from a centrally-planned closed economy into one of the world’s most dynamic and globally-integrated market economies. The dynamics unleashed by Deng Xiaoping’s reforms, open-door policies and institutional changes have unleashed enormous entrepreneurial energy and propelled continuous capital accumulation, productivity gains and trade and income growth on a scale the world has never seen before. During this period, China’s total gross domestic product (GDP), industrial output, foreign trade and, importantly, its per capita income increased respectively by factors of 8, 59, 124 and 60.1 As a result, the incidence and severity of poverty have declined dramatically in China. According to a recent World Bank report (2009), between 1981 and 2004, the fraction of China’s population consuming less than US$1 a day in today’s purchasing power fell from 65 per cent to 10 per cent and about half a billion people were lifted out of poverty. This achievement has contributed critically to global progress in reducing world absolute poverty and indeed ‘a fall in the number of poor of this magnitude over such as short period is without historical precedent’ (World Bank 2009:iii).2 The fundamental causes of this remarkable performance are by now familiar to most China observers. Market-oriented reforms centred on changes in the price system led to improved resource allocation and allowed the most dynamic private sector to flourish, thereby increasing the overall level of efficiency in the economy. Liberalisation programs allowed trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) to flourish according to China’s underlying comparative advantage, resulting in enormous gains from trade. Decentralisation and ownership transformation helped to solve incentive problems and enhance the performance of firms and local governments. And institutional reforms that abandoned the decades-long restraints on the mobility of labour unleashed an unprecedented 1 Calculated using the data taken from NBS (2007). 2 The Millennium Poverty Reduction Target aims to halve the proportion of people living in absolute poverty by 2015 compared with the level in 1990 (Thirlwall 2006). 1', 'China: The Next Twenty Years of Reform and Development scale of urbanisation, with the ratio of the urban in the total population rising from less than 20 per cent in the late 1970s to 46 per cent in 2009. This gradual process of ‘reform and opening up’ coincided with a surge in the proportion of the working-age population, generating in a ‘demographic dividend’, which, according to Cai and Wang (2005), accounted for about one-quarter of the growth rate in per capita GDP between 1982 and 2000. The sustained high rates of economic growth that resulted have fundamentally transformed the Chinese economy and its position in the world. China has also benefited during the past three decades from some favourable internal and external conditions. Internally, there were some positive legacies inherited from the planning system that were conducive to reform and growth, including a basic industrial base and reasonable infrastructure, the irrigation system and a relatively well-developed education system. In the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution, there were overwhelming domestic forces pushing for reform that helped overcome the resistance to change, especially during the early years of reform. The low base from which the economy started enabled China to benefit from low-cost advantages in production that contributed enormously to the rising output and competitiveness of the economy. Moreover, as a latecomer to economic development, China enjoyed the advantage of backwardness— that is, the ability to adopt the world’s more-advanced technologies relatively rapidly. Externally, China’s reforms have coincided with a new era of globalisation, characterised by a more open global trading environment, resulting from significant reductions in tariffs and other forms of trade protection through various rounds of multinational trade negotiations in the post-war period, and from the mid-1980s through unilateral liberalisation in the Western Pacific region. This era has also been characterised by rapid global economic structural adjustment in response to cross-border flows of capital, people and technology; and by rapid reductions in transaction costs stemming from substantial improvements in transport, communication and information management. ‘As a result, international markets have provided China with opportunities (and also risks) that far exceed those available at the time of Japan’s and Korea’s big growth spurts’ (Brandt and Rawski 2008:13). While some of these favourable conditions will remain in place during the next two decades, many of them will no longer yield the sizeable benefits to China’s economic growth that they have in the past. If China is to continue along its remarkable path of economic reform and development, it will need to adapt to these changing internal and external conditions and to steer skilfully through a number of challenges. This book highlights how the deepening of reforms in critical areas such as domestic factor markets, the exchange rate regime and the health system, combined with the strengthening of channels for effective policy 2', 'Tables implementation and the rebalancing of economic growth, will enable China to cope with the challenges that lie ahead. These include responding to the pending exhaustion of the unlimited supply of labour; playing a constructive role in reducing global trade imbalances; enhancing firms’ ability to innovate and compete in the global economy; coping with migration, urbanisation and rising inequalities on scales unknown in world history; and dealing with rising energy and metal demand in an era in which low-carbon growth has become a necessity rather than a choice. Evidence presented in this volume and elsewhere indicates that China has entered the turning point—or more accurately, the turning period—in economic development, signalled by the end of surplus labour and the consequent rapid rise in wages in some, albeit not all, sectors of the economy. The tightening of the labour market will be compounded by the combined impact of three decades of the One-Child Policy and rapid income growth on Chinese fertility rates, which has already heralded a rapidly ageing population, with the growth rate of the labour supply predicted to turn negative by about 2020 (Tyers et al. 2009). This will necessitate changes in the industrial structure and composition of trade, as China loses its comparative advantage in the labour-intensive exports that have been an engine of growth in the past. To facilitate these changes, building human capital through education, accelerating technological change through innovation and raising labour productivity through further labour-market reform are becoming increasingly urgent national priorities. Economic growth in the past has been characterised by extensive growth resulting in a number of structural imbalances, including highly resource- and energy-intensive production. Now China has entered a stage of growth in which metal and energy intensities (that is, consumption per unit of GDP) are exceptionally strong. This will significantly add to the global pressure to balance the supply of, and demand for, resources and energy products, and the impact on world markets for these products is likely to be intense (Garnaut and Song 2006). Confronting this challenge will require China to accelerate its pace of structural change by moving more quickly towards higher valued- added industrial production and the service sector and by adopting resource- and energy-saving technologies in all productive sectors. Reforming the pricing systems for energy and resources so that prices truly reflect the balance between supply and demand will be critical in this regard. Such pricing reforms will enhance supply capacities and encourage resource- and energy-saving technological change, substitutions for resource use and conservation. As one of the largest economies and the largest carbon emitter in the world, China needs to confront environmental degradation and climate change by moving more rapidly towards a low-carbon growth economy. This is not only for the health and welfare of China’s own population, but for the world 3', 'China: The Next Twenty Years of Reform and Development to stand any chance of achieving the goal of significantly reducing global emissions before catastrophic problems occur (Stern 2007; Garnaut 2008). In so doing, China will need to overcome many difficulties associated with the current level of per capita income, the mid-phase of its industrialisation and the vast regional disparities with respect to the levels of income and industrial development. The transition towards developing a low-carbon economy might not necessarily compromise economic growth, as developing environmentally- friendly industries can generate new sources of growth. The key challenge is to set up an appropriate system in which all parties involved, including the central government, local governments, firms and households, will have incentives to make the necessary adjustments (Cai and Du 2008). The stark conflict between the contemporary style of industrial development and the health of the biosphere indicates strongly that now is the time for China to make the adjustments that will underpin sustainable long-term growth (McKay and Song 2010). Enhancing productivity is a crucial component of the shift towards a low-carbon mode of economic growth. Technological progress and innovation hol\n",

Our sources do not provide an answer to the third question, but they suggest a middle ground on the first two. Understanding what is happening in China’s economy requires a change of perspective. For example, the Shanghai CHINA ANALYSIS ABOUT', 'FTZ was internationally heralded a year ago as signalling that between those who favour adaptation to market competition China would soon lift capital controls. This is not happening. and real though selective reforms and those who represent Apart from the regional and factional competition that often very profitable special interests, who argue that “if it ain’t goes with new “models” in China (the first director of the broke, don’t fix it”. For China, the consequences to foreign FTZ is now under arrest on corruption charges), the FTZ is firms and partners are incidental to this permanent debate. now functioning as a testing ground (to be replicated soon in Tianjin, Guangdong, and Fujian) for the state and Chinese firms to experiment with lighter administrative rules, with some international flexibility thrown in. In short, it is more an incubator for Chinese domestic firms to experiment with a full market economy than a paradise for foreign capital. Similarly, the fashion today is to focus on outward investment by China, the “going out” of Chinese firms that is finally in 2014 balancing inward FDI to China. Our sources point out that inward FDI still plays an important role. This is not because foreign capital is needed – China is awash with money – but because FDI is a catalyst that helps to instil competition within the Chinese economy. Revamping FDI rules is also a tool to aid negotiations with the United States on a bilateral investment treaty (strikingly, our sources leave out Europe, in spite of three rounds of negotiation with the European Union in 2014). At base, the strategy is neither pro- nor anti-foreign, although some of the implications are ominous: regulation and the role of foreign capital will change as dictated by the needs of the Chinese economy. Where global capitalism wants the rules of the game to be unchangeable, the Chinese Communist Party has always timed its concessions: nothing is eternal except the party itself. Thus our sources, who start by emphasising the need to continue to attract FDI, end with a suggestion to toughen post-establishment enforcement of rules for foreign firms: precisely the area where the European Chamber of Commerce is seeking clarification and liberalisation. And the sources favour ending any preferential treatment for foreign firms. China’s Anti-Monopoly Law was criticised abroad recently when it was applied to foreign auto firms (joint ventures, really, although the Chinese partners were never put in the spotlight). Our sources concede that there has been selective and political implementation. But they have a local explanation that makes the issue of economic nationalism a secondary point: the National Development and Reform Commission, frustrated by the collusion of Chinese lobbies with the Ministry of Commerce, has decided to go after high- profile foreign firms in order to increase its own legitimacy. Our sources point out that the real targets should be the “tigers” of China’s domestic economy, especially the administrative monopolies (oil and gas, telecoms, and finance). Whether they will be listened to is obviously an open question. There is a lesson here for China’s partners: what happens in China should not be looked at entirely from the point of view of an ideological axis (global rules and liberalisation vs. statist rule and indigenous preference).

The debate over the rise of China, while useful in highlighting the security implications of China’s emergence as an economic power, fails to address the numerous non-military challenges Chinese economic growth poses for Asia-Pacific countries. Environmental degradation, resource scarcity, and public health concerns are a few of the issues that will shape China’s interaction with the region. These problems, emanating from the developmental choices Chinese governments have made over the past 25 years of reform create risk for China and its neighbors. How leaders in China and in neighboring states manage that risk will play a key role in determining the Asian security environment in the 21st century. The China Threat Debate Reassessed Depending on the focus of analysis, there is a striking difference in the evaluation of the consequences of Chinese economic development. On one hand, scholars of China’s domestic politics rightly call attention to the significant governance problems Chinese leaders face as they proceed with the third decade of economic reforms. These analysts study the effectiveness of the Chinese state in regulating social ills to better understand China’s prospects for democratization and social stability.1 On the other hand, as we will see below, scholars of China’s foreign policy, who seek to evaluate China’s role in the international system, focus on a different slice of', 'Elizabeth Wishnick 2 Chinese reality. They center their attention on China’s military capabilities and intentions and the security consequences of China’s economic rise. Non-military factors of security are rarely included in their assessments, although issues like the environment and public health figure prominently in the risk management strategies that China’s neighbors employ. While the rise of China debate generates policy prescriptions along the familiar containment/engagement continuum, transnational problems engendering risk call for a wider range of risk management strategies, which may be used in combination, including containment and engagement, but also involving intervention (such as the role of the World Health Organization (WHO) during the SARS epidemic), defensive strategies (border controls, quarantines), financial incentives (for example to install green technology) and competition (for energy resources, etc.). This paper reexamines the debate over the rise of China. Instead of focusing solely on China’s military intentions and capabilities, it is argued that non-military factors of security also should be taken into account to gain a more balanced assessment of the security consequences of China’s rise. The concept of risk, derived from Ulrich Beck’s World Risk Society, is introduced and applied to two cases: 1) environmental risk and Northeast Asia; and 2) public health risk and Southeast Asia. These cases show that a China with poor transparency and weak regulatory capacity causes risk for China’s neighbors, requiring a varied set of risk management strategies. This is a working paper, reflecting work in progress on the conceptual framework and case research, not a completed study. It is being presented here to stimulate', 'Elizabeth Wishnick 3 discussion as I refine my ideas further and gather additional information about the cases. Future plans for the project are outlined in Part III. Part I: Conceptualizing China’s Rise and Its Consequences The debate over the consequences of China’s rise reflects the remarkable economic growth it has achieved during the past 25 years of reform. Since Deng Xiaoping first launched economic reform in 1978, China has had an average annual growth rate of more than 9% and China now has the second largest economy after the United States.2 In its July 2005 report, the Pentagon estimates that the Chinese military budget could be as high as $90 billion, making China the third largest defense spender after the United States and Russia, and the leader by far in defense spending in Asia.3 With a population of 1.3 billion, China has 21.5% of the world’s population. In the early 1990s a debate unfolded in the United States about the security implications of China’s economic growth. Scholars and policy analysts have divided into two camps. Realists focus on Chinese capabilities: some see signs of a rising China, with expanding military and economic power that could pose a threat to its neighbors in Asia, while others dispute the “China threat” thesis and view China as relatively weak and plagued by social problems. Liberal institutionalists acknowledge that China’s power has grown, but claim that China is becoming more responsible, joining international organizations and accepting global norms. Despite many fundamental disagreements, both realists and liberal institutionalists are united in their focus on Chinese intentions and capabilities. They seek to understand how much power China has and how Chinese leaders seek to use these resources.', 'Elizabeth Wishnick 4 In 1993, in one of the early contributions to this discussion, New York Times journalist Nicolas Kristof noted: “The rise of China, if it continues, may be the most important trend in the world for the next century.”4 Viewing China’s nuclear arsenal, border disputes with its neighbors, and fast growing economy and military budget, Kristof posed the following questions: * Does China’s attempt to expand its influence reflect the hostile intentions of an aggressive regime or is it the natural consequence of a rising power? * Is China trying to achieve a more powerful foreign policy role that matches its economic power? * Will China be responsible with its new power? Since the early 1990s, the debate in the West5 over the rise of China has largely focused on answers to these questions. Responses can be broken down into three positions: 1) A rising China poses a potential threat; 2) China remains weak and poses no threat; and 3) China is becoming increasingly responsible and integrated. The first two positions examine China’s intentions and capabilities from a realist perspective, while the third takes a liberal institutionalist view of the role of international institutions and norms in moderating Chinese behavior. Some examples of these positions are provided below. This review is meant to be illustrative, rather than comprehensive. Position One: A Rising China Poses a Potential Threat In The Coming Conflict with China (1997) Richard Bernstein and Ross H. Munro outlined how a rising China could become a threat to its neighbors. The authors asserted that it was a mistake to believe that reforms were helping China to become more like the', 'Elizabeth Wishnick 5 United States. Instead, they argued, Chinese leaders are driven by nationalism to replace the United States as the dominant world power. Because the United States represented the main obstacle to Chinese ambitions, conflict is inevitable. Thus, according to Bernstein and Munro, China’s efforts to improve relations should be viewed as tactical. China’s integration into the world economy was not moderating its behavior: to the contrary, \n",

As the role of political parties declines, and globalization creates socioeconomic uncertainties that unsettle anxious electorates, anti-establishment figures or movements have found it easy to attract support. Whether Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, Thaksin Shinawatra in Thailand, Narendra Modi in India, or Alexis Tsipras in Greece, popu- lists have been able to mobilize voters by attacking a supposedly col- lective enemy (mostly, domestic or foreign forces accused of exploiting the country’s economic resources) and by appealing to the poor as their main constituency. In some cases, populists have been so success- ful at the ballot box that established political forces resorted to vio- lence to try removing them—as evidenced by the failed coup against Chavez in 2002, and the military overthrows of Thaksin in 2006 and of his sister, Yingluck, in 2014. Quite unusually, the 2014 presidential election in Indonesia was a contest between two populists, albeit of a very different kind. Prabowo Subianto, the former son-in-law of the country’s long-time auto crat Suharto, followed almost all the guidelines of classic text- book populism: he condemned the Jokowi didn’t promise to revamp existing polity as broken and the political system—he offered beyond repair; he attacked for- change within the framework of eign companies for ex tracting In- donesia’s natural wealth without the democratic status quo proper compensation; he portrayed', 'xii Marcus Mietzner the domestic elites as cronies of those foreign parasites; he appealed primarily to the poor, uneducated, and rural population for support; and he pursued an inherently anti-democratic agenda, promising tougher leadership instead of lengthy, multilayered deliberations. By contrast, his opponent, Jakarta governor Joko Widodo (“Jokowi”), introduced a new form of populism that differed from the standard version in several ways. First, Jokowi did not promise to completely revamp the political system—he offered change within the framework of the democratic status quo. Second, he did not target any particular actor or group as an enemy, instead presenting himself as highly inclusivist. And third, he refrained from anti-foreign rhetoric to shore up support. As a substitute, he focused on improved public service delivery as the core element of his platform, and relied on his man-of-the-people image to bind ordinary voters to his cause. Suc- cesses in the areas of health and education reform, plus a carefully cultivated down-to-earth attitude, had delivered Jokowi electoral vic- tories and strong approval ratings in the city of Solo, where he had been mayor, and in Jakarta. Thus, Jokowi pitched his technocratic, intra-systemic populism against Prabowo’s ultra-nationalist, confron- tational populism. This study explores the dynamics of the electoral contest between Prabowo and Jokowi, and analyzes what they tell us about the condi- tions under which populist campaigns are launched and succeed or fail. It shows that Prabowo’s classic populist campaign ultimately col- lapsed because, unlike many other polities in which successful popu- list challenges were launched, Indonesia’s post-Suharto democracy was not in a state of acute, life-threatening crisis. While there was sim- mering discontent, support for democracy remained high among the electorate; economic conditions were stable; and the majority of vot- ers, in general, did not desire regime change. In addition, Prabowo, who originated from a wealthy, established political family, found it difficult to gain credibility among Indonesia’s poor, especially when confronted with Jokowi’s biography of genuinely humble beginnings. The victory of Jokowi’s technocratic populism, then, reflected the mood of Indonesia’s electorate 16 years after the end of authoritarian- ism. There was frustration about the ineffectiveness of service delivery, and about the corruption in established political parties and institu- t\n",

The debate over the rise of China, while useful in highlighting the security implications of China’s emergence as an economic power, fails to address the numerous non-military challenges Chinese economic growth poses for Asia-Pacific countries. Environmental degradation, resource scarcity, and public health concerns are a few of the issues that will shape China’s interaction with the region. These problems, emanating from the developmental choices Chinese governments have made over the past 25 years of reform create risk for China and its neighbors. How leaders in China and in neighboring states manage that risk will play a key role in determining the Asian security environment in the 21st century. The China Threat Debate Reassessed Depending on the focus of analysis, there is a striking difference in the evaluation of the consequences of Chinese economic development. On one hand, scholars of China’s domestic politics rightly call attention to the significant governance problems Chinese leaders face as they proceed with the third decade of economic reforms. These analysts study the effectiveness of the Chinese state in regulating social ills to better understand China’s prospects for democratization and social stability.1 On the other hand, as we will see below, scholars of China’s foreign policy, who seek to evaluate China’s role in the international system, focus on a different slice of', 'Elizabeth Wishnick 2 Chinese reality. They center their attention on China’s military capabilities and intentions and the security consequences of China’s economic rise. Non-military factors of security are rarely included in their assessments, although issues like the environment and public health figure prominently in the risk management strategies that China’s neighbors employ. While the rise of China debate generates policy prescriptions along the familiar containment/engagement continuum, transnational problems engendering risk call for a wider range of risk management strategies, which may be used in combination, including containment and engagement, but also involving intervention (such as the role of the World Health Organization (WHO) during the SARS epidemic), defensive strategies (border controls, quarantines), financial incentives (for example to install green technology) and competition (for energy resources, etc.). This paper reexamines the debate over the rise of China. Instead of focusing solely on China’s military intentions and capabilities, it is argued that non-military factors of security also should be taken into account to gain a more balanced assessment of the security consequences of China’s rise. The concept of risk, derived from Ulrich Beck’s World Risk Society, is introduced and applied to two cases: 1) environmental risk and Northeast Asia; and 2) public health risk and Southeast Asia. These cases show that a China with poor transparency and weak regulatory capacity causes risk for China’s neighbors, requiring a varied set of risk management strategies. This is a working paper, reflecting work in progress on the conceptual framework and case research, not a completed study. It is being presented here to stimulate', 'Elizabeth Wishnick 3 discussion as I refine my ideas further and gather additional information about the cases. Future plans for the project are outlined in Part III. Part I: Conceptualizing China’s Rise and Its Consequences The debate over the consequences of China’s rise reflects the remarkable economic growth it has achieved during the past 25 years of reform. Since Deng Xiaoping first launched economic reform in 1978, China has had an average annual growth rate of more than 9% and China now has the second largest economy after the United States.2 In its July 2005 report, the Pentagon estimates that the Chinese military budget could be as high as $90 billion, making China the third largest defense spender after the United States and Russia, and the leader by far in defense spending in Asia.3 With a population of 1.3 billion, China has 21.5% of the world’s population. In the early 1990s a debate unfolded in the United States about the security implications of China’s economic growth. Scholars and policy analysts have divided into two camps. Realists focus on Chinese capabilities: some see signs of a rising China, with expanding military and economic power that could pose a threat to its neighbors in Asia, while others dispute the “China threat” thesis and view China as relatively weak and plagued by social problems. Liberal institutionalists acknowledge that China’s power has grown, but claim that China is becoming more responsible, joining international organizations and accepting global norms. Despite many fundamental disagreements, both realists and liberal institutionalists are united in their focus on Chinese intentions and capabilities. They seek to understand how much power China has and how Chinese leaders seek to use these resources.', 'Elizabeth Wishnick 4 In 1993, in one of the early contributions to this discussion, New York Times journalist Nicolas Kristof noted: “The rise of China, if it continues, may be the most important trend in the world for the next century.”4 Viewing China’s nuclear arsenal, border disputes with its neighbors, and fast growing economy and military budget, Kristof posed the following questions: * Does China’s attempt to expand its influence reflect the hostile intentions of an aggressive regime or is it the natural consequence of a rising power? * Is China trying to achieve a more powerful foreign policy role that matches its economic power? * Will China be responsible with its new power? Since the early 1990s, the debate in the West5 over the rise of China has largely focused on answers to these questions. Responses can be broken down into three positions: 1) A rising China poses a potential threat; 2) China remains weak and poses no threat; and 3) China is becoming increasingly responsible and integrated. The first two positions examine China’s intentions and capabilities from a realist perspective, while the third takes a liberal institutionalist view of the role of international institutions and norms in moderating Chinese behavior. Some examples of these positions are provided below. This review is meant to be illustrative, rather than comprehensive. Position One: A Rising China Poses a Potential Threat In The Coming Conflict with China (1997) Richard Bernstein and Ross H. Munro outlined how a rising China could become a threat to its neighbors. The authors asserted that it was a mistake to believe that reforms were helping China to become more like the', 'Elizabeth Wishnick 5 United States. Instead, they argued, Chinese leaders are driven by nationalism to replace the United States as the dominant world power. Because the United States represented the main obstacle to Chinese ambitions, conflict is inevitable. Thus, according to Bernstein and Munro, China’s efforts to improve relations should be viewed as tactical. China’s integration into the world economy was not moderating its behavior: to the contrary, \n",

            "['chapter 1 Introduction: Citizenship and Democratization in Postcolonial Southeast Asia Ward Berenschot, Henk Schulte Nordholt and Laurens Bakker Paradox. Bemused observers seem to prefer this word to describe the nature of democratization processes across Southeast Asia. From the Philippines ( Dressel 2011) to Thailand (Kuhonta 2008) and Indonesia (Hadiz and Robison 2005) commentators are using the word ‘paradox’ to describe a remarkable similar puzzle. The widening of political and civil rights after the fall of au- thoritarian regimes in Thailand (1992), Philippines (1986) and Indonesia (1998) (and to some extent Malaysia after the resignation of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed in 2003) has on the one hand led to a much livelier public sphere, a freer and more active public debate and an intensified political participation. New protest movements – such as the anti-corruption movements in Indone- sia and Malaysia or the Red versus Yellow protests in Thailand – have succeed- ed in organizing big protests and challenging ruling elites. Moreover, electoral democracy can be termed a success. Yet on the other hand, the successful institution of free and fair elections seems to have done little to curtail the dominance of oligarchic elites and patronage politics. Throughout Southeast Asia, observers are discerning the development of ‘patronage democracies’ (Walker 2012; Crouch 2010; Van Klinken 2009; Schulte Nordholt and Van Klinken 2007; Simandjuntak 2010) as ‘predatory elites’ (Hadiz 2010) are succeeding in winning elections by using either their ‘money power’ to buy voters or, if that fails, the ‘muscle power’ of allied criminal elements to coerce them (Aspinall and Van Klinken 2010). In these contests the efforts to woo voters by presenting some sort of policy platform is kept to a minimum, as election speeches are filled with appeals to ethnic identities (Schulte Nordholt 2008, 2011) and promises of preferen- tial access to state resources. Often weakly organized, the activities of political parties are mostly geared towards facilitating clientelistic exchanges between politicians and voters, rather than facilitating public debate or developing programmatic policy agendas (Tomsa and Ufen 2012). Popular representa- tion often seems flawed and ‘substantial democratization’ remains elusive ( Törnquist 2005; Törnquist et al. 2009). Particularly striking is the relatively little impact that democratic reforms and widening press freedom seem to have on the practice of business elites © Ward Berenschot et al., ���7 | doi �0.��63/97890043�9669_00� This is an open access chapter distributed under the terms of the CC-BY-NC-ND License. <UN>', '2 Berenschot et al. to strike up deals with political elites in order to gain access to lucrative resources – such as government contracts, exclusive concessions to extract natural resources, exclusive import rights, et cetera. This collusion between business, bureaucrats and politicians not only severely weakens legal institu- tions (A spinall and Van Klinken 2010) but also leads to a loss of income for Southeast Asian states, higher prices for consumers and increasing income inequalities. Yet citizens are failing to use their newly won democratic freedoms to end such practices. As Jeffrey Winters (2011:156) writes with puzzlement about Indonesia, ‘It would not be easy to find another country where so much fabulous wealth could be held by oligarchs who are surrounded by so many millions of people living in so much poverty and frustration, and yet oligarchs face no imminent threats from below and somehow operate economically without the protections of property rights based on the rule of law’. How can this paradox be explained? Why have democratic reforms in Southeast Asia so rarely enabled citizens to resist or end the predatory and cli- entelistic practices of their political elites? The persistence of these practices and the ‘stalling’ (Mietzner 2011) of Southeast Asian democratization processes cannot be attributed solely to institutional shortcomings or selfish behaviour of elites. Instead, there is an urgent need to study these practices ‘from below’ by studying the ways in which citizenship is being perceived and practiced by ordinary Southeast Asians. This book, therefore, aims to highlight the impor- tance of studying changing forms of citizenship in Southeast Asia in order to understand the particularities of democratization processes in the region. Citizenship has rarely been a topic in both public and academic debates in Southeast Asia. On the one hand contributions to public debate rarely – or, in our eyes: not often enough – conceptualize the challenges facing Southeast Asian democracies in terms of citizenship. While debates rage on about the nature of democracy, ideal political leadership or the need to raise political moral standards, there is relatively little discussion about what democratic citi- zenship in present-day Southeast Asia is or should entail.1 Conversely, the field of citizenship studies has also paid surprisingly little attention to the forms that 1 For instance, the animated discussions about ‘money politics’ and corruption generally focus on the lack of moral backbone of political and bureaucratic elites. Similarly, while public dis- course in the region displays a lot of nationalistic fervour, there is relatively little discussion on how such patriotic sentiments coincide (and often clash) with attachment to one’s ethnic or regional community. While democratic transformations have created more opportunities for the expression of (and mobilization around) various sub-national identities (see David- son and Henley 2007), a normative debate on the possible tensions between national and ethnic conceptions of the common good occurs only rarely. <UN>', 'Introduction 3 democratic citizenship takes in postcolonial states. As citizenship is generally studied in the context of a liberal, high-capacity welfare state, there has been relatively little attention for the forms of democratic citizenship in the con- text of a more weakly institutionalized state and a predominantly c lientelistic political system.2 In these states the rights-claiming, autonomous and indi- vidualistic citizen – as celebrated in the general literature on citizenship – might be found, but a focus on this particular type of citizen is hindering a much needed understanding of the very different kinds of state– citizen interactions prevailing in many postcolonial states (Robins 2008; Cornwall et al. 2011). These interactions should not be studied in terms of their deviation from idealized Western patterns. Rather, we need an understanding of how par- ticular conceptions and practice of rights, reciprocity and representation observable in postcolonial countries, are related to their political economy and particular history of state formation (Chatterjee 2004; Chabal and Daloz 1999; Kaviraj 2001; Mamdani 1996). For example, different interpretations of the ‘proper’ relation between the ruler and the ruled should not only be related to age-old cultural or religious traditions concerning the nature of political authority (see Anderson 1972; Day 2002), but also to historical processes of (post)colonial state formation and the way political accountability takes shape in the context of a particular political economy. Such an approach will not only increase our understanding of how postcolonial trajectories of state for- mation are shaping contemporary forms of citizenship, it also requires us to re-examine the normative connotations inherent in our conceptualization of the citizenship ideal. The patterns of citizenship found in postcolonial states cannot be described merely as a ‘cluster of absences’ (Isin 2002:130) as they also hint at new, different reformulations of citizenship ideals. As Partha Chatterjee (2011:24, 205) asked, ‘Could the accumulation of exceptions justify a redefinition of the norm?’ He argues that this accumulation of exceptions poses ...one of the principal tasks of political theory today: to provide a con- ceptual map of the merging practices of the new political societies of the East. The normative models of Western political theory have, more often than not, only served to show non-Western practices as backward 2 It is, for example, striking how important realities of political life in postcolonial states – such as clientelistic politics and a dependence on patronage channels – receive no mention in overview studies such as the Handbook of Citizenship Studies (Turner and Isin 2002; see also Kivisto and Faist 2007). <UN>', '4 Berenschot et al. or deviant....What we need is a different conceptualization of the subject of political practice- neither as abstract and unencumbered individual selves nor as manipulable objects of governmental policy, but rather as concrete selves necessarily acting within multiple networks of collec- tive obligations and solidarities to work out strategies of coping with ( resisting, or using to their advantage the vast array of technologies of power deployed by) the modern state. This reconceptualization of citizenship is, we might add, just as much a task of empirical social science as it is of political theory, as this task requires us to start from everyday state–citizen interactions rather than abstract idealized forms of citizenship. That is the aim of this book. By providing various fascinat- ing first-hand accounts of how citizenship is being practiced and perceived, this book highlights the importance of studying citizenship to understand the unfolding of democratization processes in postcolonial states. Instead of departing from the normative ideal of citizenship, we tried to depart from the practices, values and attitudes that can be observed in everyday interac- tions between citizens and states. From these concrete interactions can be in- ferred how citizens interpret and realize, for example, the recognition of their proper\n",

The government im- posed bans on peaceful protests, including strikes by trade unions campaigning for increased wages. In some cases, protesters engaged in attacks in response to security force repression. A July 2014, CPP-CNRP agreement ended the opposition’s boycott of the National Assembly. The agreement, which followed the arrest of prominent CNRP leader Mu Sochua, and six other CNRP assembly members on trumped-up charges, failed to commit the CPP to implement institutional and legal reforms to ensure that future elections will be free and fair, or to guarantee freedom of expression and opinion, peaceful assembly and association, or fair trials. Poverty remained particularly severe in the countryside, while urban workers also suffered from wages so low they contribute to widespread malnutrition. Vic- tims of land concessions to agro-industrial business interests—the major cause of dispossession of land from farmers, and resulting land disputes—made little progress in receiving adequate compensation and resettlement packages. Gov- ernment officials and judges remained mired in corruption, but almost all were immune from action by courts and the government’s Anti-Corruption Unit, which only targeted petty cases involving those without CPP political protection. Excessive Use of Lethal and Other Force In early January, authorities banned all protests, in part to try to force organized labor in the garment industry to lower their demands for a minimum wage in- crease. Gendarme, police, and para-police personnel killed at least seven peo- ple and injured dozens of others mostly during the first seven months of the year, before the ban was partly lifted. Protesters also injured several members of the security forces. 133', 'World Report 2015 Book NEW_World Report 2015 Book 1/6/15 6:56 PM Page 134 WORLD REPORT 2015 Impunity and Politically Motivated Prosecutions Since the CPP has been in power, members and commanders of government se- curity forces have enjoyed impunity from investigation, let alone prosecution, for serious human rights abuses, including political assassinations, other extrajudi- cial killings, and torture. Instead, politically partisan police, prosecutors, and judges pursued at least 87 trumped-up cases against CNRP leaders and activists, members of other opposition political groups, prominent trade union figures, urban civil society organizers, and ordinary workers from factories around Phnom Penh. The Phnom Penh Municipal Court sentenced 55 people to prison after unfair tri- als, on charges such as “treacherously plotting” to stage an armed insurrection, or instigating, inciting, or perpetrating violence, obstructing traffic, or “violent resistance against a public official.” In these proceedings, no credible evidence was presented to support a guilty verdict, while evidence of security force vio- lence was systematically disallowed. Although 30 of the 55 received suspended sentences, 23 had already spent many months of pretrial detention in an over- crowded, substandard, and isolated prison. Criminal cases pending included, alleged incitement to violence by CNRP Presi- dent Sam Rainsy, Vice President Kem Sokha, and union leader Rong Chhun for opposing the government’s blanket ban on protests; charges against seven other CNRP assembly members and nine CNRP activists for leading, or participat- ing in a violent “insurrection” and other crimes related to a security force-pro- voked melee at a CNRP-sponsored protest in July 2014; charges of incitement to violence and other crimes against six union leaders in connection with worker unrest during a general strike in December 2013-January 2014; charges of “treacherous plotting” and other crimes against a political activist for distribut- ing a banned book in 2014; and charges against a Buddhist monk and three youths in connection with protests against election unfairness and other alleged government abuses dating back to 2011. Land Confiscation and Forced Evictions The ill-effects of often illegal land acquisitions, by politically powerful individu- als and their business partners, and forced evictions, continued to mount. The 134', 'World Report 2015 Book NEW_World Report 2015 Book 1/6/15 6:56 PM Page 135 HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH number of people affected by state-involved land conflicts since 2000 passed the half-million mark in March 2014, according to calculations by the local non- governmental organization LICADHO. The rate of new disputes was higher than in 2013. Many of the new disputes ensued from the failure of the authorities to distribute land titles awarded to rural residents as part of a 2012-2013 scheme, personally conceived and overseen by Hun Sen. In August 2o14, Hun Sen blamed his government subordinates for failing to re- solve disputes, repeating many previous pledges to end unlawful land takings. At least four people remain imprisoned after convictions in previous years for op- posing land takings, while charges against at least 19 others were pending in various provincial courts. Arbitrary Detention, Torture, and Other Ill-Treatment The authorities detained hundreds of people they deemed to be “undesirable,” without judicial recourse in so-called drug treatment centers, where they face torture, sexual violence, and—in at least two centers—forced labor. Authorities locked up alleged drug users, homeless people, beggars, street children, sex workers, and people with disabilities in these centers for arbitrary periods. People held during investigation, or prosecution for common criminal offenses, or convicted in court, were still routinely tortured, or otherwise ill-treated. The police and prison authorities, beat, pistol-whipped, used electro-shock, kicked, slapped, and punched inmates, often until they become unconscious. Much of the torture was aimed at extracting confessions or extorting money. New Laws Strengthening Government Control of the Judiciary Amid politically motivated prosecutions and unfair trials, the CPP further tight- ened its control over the judiciary by rushing passage of three laws through the National Assembly during the opposition boycott. Laws on the Organization of the Courts, the Statute of Judges and Prosecutors, and the Organization and Functioning of the Supreme Council of the Magistracy, promulgated on July 13, 2014, increased government control over a politically subservient Supreme Council of the Magistracy, and weakened provisions for ju- dicial independence. 135', 'World Report 2015 Book NEW_World Report 2015 Book 1/6/15 6:56 PM Page 136 WORLD REPORT 2015 Together, the laws facilitated further encroachment by the government on areas properly reserved for the judiciary under the principle of separation of powers in- cluding, government control over the judiciary’s budgetary finance and adminis- trative matters, restrictions on the rights of judges and prosecutors to freedom of expression, and fewer safeguards for judicial independence in selection, promo- tion, removal, and disciplinary procedures for judges.

These were committed as part of the Khmer Rouge’s forced relocations of Cambodians from urban areas to the countryside and around the countryside in 1975, during which many were exe- cuted. The two continued to face trial on other charges, including genocide, in connec- tion with Khmer Rouge policies and practices from 1975 to 1979. However, given their advanced age, it was far from certain that a second trial would ever be com- pleted. Hun Sen’s public opposition to trials of other Khmer Rouge suspects made it unlikely that others responsible for the deaths of as many as 2 million people, would be held accountable. While the trial had initially generated con- siderable interest, the drawn-out proceedings over many years resulted in the Cambodian public showing little interest by the trial’s end. Labor Rights The brutal suppression of garment and textile worker protests in January, and the subsequent prosecution of labor leaders and workers on trumped-up charges, did not deter some trade unions from continuing to protest for an increased min- imum wage, demanding US$177 monthly, as suggested in a government task 136', 'World Report 2015 Book NEW_World Report 2015 Book 1/6/15 6:56 PM Page 137 HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH force report. Instead, the government on November 12 declared a minimum wage of $128. The authorities introduced more burdensome procedures for union registration, and independent unions complained that their union registration was intention- ally being delayed. The government also moved toward passage of a revised law on trade unions that fell far short of international standards guaranteeing free- dom of association.

            "['Thus, within most cities and towns in low- and middle-income nations, risks fall disproportionately on the population living on particular high-risk sites and with the least adequate provision for protective infrastructure and services. The principal driver of increasing loss of life as well as social and economic vulnerability is poverty (limiting individual, household and community investments) and exclusion (limiting public investments and services). Climate change not only exacerbates existing risks but also reveals new hidden vulnerabilities as more locations are exposed to more intense floods and storms. To date, there has been relatively little consideration of what adaptation will be needed in urban areas in low- and middle-income countries. In part, this is because so much of the IPCC’s attention has been focused on persuading governments to accept the scientific evidence for human-induced climate change, and the pressing need for mitigation. Currently it is natural scientists who have produced most of the evidence for human-induced climate change, and who are most strongly represented in government and international-agency discussions or actions on climate change. This has also meant a greater scientific knowledge of likely climate-change impacts on agriculture, forestry and ecosystems than on the built environment. The National Adaptation Programmes of Action on climate change developed by governments within the least developed countries were developed primarily by ministries of the environment – not ministries of housing or public works or local government (all of whom will have key roles in adaptation). In addition, mitigation can be driven as a national agenda, promoted by international agreement, whereas effective adaptation needs to be locally driven, in part because adaptation measures must be rooted in the particulars of each local economic, social, political and ecological context. Further, as discussed in this paper, for urban areas, most measures will have to be implemented or supported by different departments of local government. This will require local governments prepared to work with the groups most at risk – including large sections of the population with low incomes living in informal or illegal settlements and working in the informal economy. One final reason for the lack of attention to urban areas is the longstanding antipathy within most bilateral aid agencies and much of the development community to any focus on urban areas. 3. A conceptual framework: From asset vulnerability to asset adaptation A social development perspective on urban climate-change adaptation focuses on both the risks and the impacts of such changes on the poor, excluded and marginal populations living in urban areas. Recognition that poor populations are particularly vulnerable to climate change in terms of individual lives, but also in relation to their household and community assets, makes it useful to draw on earlier conceptual and operational frameworks on poverty, vulnerability and assets (Moser 1998; 2007; 2008), and to modify these to address the particular problems associated with climate change. Asset vulnerability Analysis of the risks arising from climate change to low-income urban households and communities is grounded in the concept of vulnerability. This draws on an important development literature that recognizes poverty as more than income- or consumption poverty and that captures the multidimensional aspects of changing socioeconomic wellbeing.1 Moser (1998) in an urban study defines vulnerability as insecurity in the wellbeing 1 Sen’s (1981) work on famines and entitlements, assets and capabilities, as well as that of Chambers (1992; 1994) and others on risk and vulnerability influenced an extensive debate that defined concepts such as capabilities and endowments, and distinguished between poverty as a static concept, and vulnerability as a dynamic one that better captures change processes as ‘people move in and out of poverty’ (Lipton and Maxwell 1992, 10). 5', 'of individuals, households and communities, including sensitivity to change. Vulnerability can be understood in terms of a lack of resilience to changes that threaten welfare; these can be environmental, economic, social and political, and they can take the form of sudden shocks, long-term trends, or seasonal cycles. Such changes usually bring increasing risk and uncertainty. Although the concept of vulnerability has focused mainly on its social and economic components, in applying it to climate change, vulnerability to physical hazards becomes more important. Also of operational relevance to climate-change-related vulnerability is the distinction between vulnerability and capacity/capability which is linked to resilience. The emergency relief literature has shown that people are not ‘helpless victims’ but have many resources even at times of emergency, and that these should form the basis for responses (Longhurst 1994; ACHR 2005); there is also widespread recognition of the resources that grassroots organizations can bring to adaptation (Satterthwaite et al. 2007; Huq and Reid 2007). When sudden shocks or disasters occur, the capabilities of individuals and households are deeply influenced by factors ranging from the damage or destruction of their homes/assets to constraints on prospects of earning a living, to the social and psychological effects of deprivation and exclusion including the socially generated sense of helplessness that often accompanies crisis. The fact that vulnerability can be applied to a range of hazards, stresses and shocks offers a particular advantage to the analysis of climate-change-related risks in urban contexts. Urban poor populations generally have to live with multiple risks and have to manage the costs and benefits of overlapping hazards from a range of environmental sources while also facing economic, political and social constraints. Climate change brings a futures dimension to understanding vulnerability. It highlights the uncertainty of future risk and with this an uncertainty concerning the bundle of assets that will enable adaptation and greater resilience, or lead to increased vulnerability. An asset-based vulnerability approach that incorporates social, economic, political, physical, human and environmental resources allows for flexibility in analysis and in planning interventions that is harder to maintain within a hazard-specific approach. It also highlights how many assets serve to reduce vulnerability to a range of hazards. Box 1: Definition of the most important capital assets for individuals, households and communities ƒ Physical capital: the stock of plant, equipment, infrastructure and other productive resources owned by individuals, the business sector or the country itself. ƒ Financial capital: the financial resources available to people (savings, supplies of credit). ƒ Human capital: investments in education, health and nutrition of individuals. Labour is linked to investments in human capital; health status influences people’s capacity to work, and skill and education determine the returns from their labour. ƒ Social capital: an intangible asset, defined as the rules, norms, obligations, reciprocity and trust embedded in social relations, social structures, and societies’ institutional arrangements. It is embedded at the micro-institutional level (communities and households) as well as in the rules and regulations governing formalized institutions in the marketplace, political system and civil society. ƒ Natural capital: the stock of environmentally provided assets such as soil, atmosphere, forests, minerals, water and wetlands. In rural communities land is a critical productive asset for the poor; in urban areas, land for shelter is also a critical productive asset. Sources: Bebbington (1999); Carney (1998); Moser (1998); Narayan (1997); Portes (1998); Putnam (1993) 6', 'Vulnerability is closely linked to a lack of assets. The more assets people have, the less vulnerable they generally are; the greater the erosion of people’s assets, the greater their insecurity. As a starting point, it is useful to identify how assets are defined, as well as those of particular importance in the context of climate change. Generally, an asset is identified as a “stock of financial, human, natural or social resources that can be acquired, developed, improved and transferred across generations. It generates flows or consumption, as well as additional stock” (Ford Foundation 2004, page 9). In the current poverty-related development debates, the concept of assets or capital endowments includes both tangible and intangible assets, with the assets of the poor commonly identified as natural, physical, social, financial and human capital (Box 1).2 In impact assessments after disasters, assets are shown to be both a significant factor in self-recovery and to be influenced by the response and reconstruction process. Where survivors participate in decision-making, psychological recovery strengthens the recovery of livelihoods and wellbeing. Reconstruction is a period in which either entitlements can be re-negotiated to improve the capacity and wellbeing of the poor, or poverty and inequality can be entrenched through the corresponding reconstruction of vulnerability. Asset-based adaptation Asset-based approaches to development are not new and, as with poverty, definitions are rooted in the 1990s debates on international poverty. Assets are closely linked to the concept of capabilities. Thus assets “are not simply resources that people use to build livelihoods: they give them the capability to be and act” (Bebbington 1999, page 2029). As such, assets are identified as the basis of agents’ power to act to reproduce, challenge or change the rules that govern the control, use and transformation of resources (Sen 1997).

Flood-prone areas are identified as those experiencing frequent and/or having a high potential for natural disasters such as flooding (see also Figure 5). Most areas in Bojonegoro are located in the Solo River watershed, which is a flood-prone area. Flooding is mostly caused by Bengawan Solo River basin overflow: the higher the intensity of the overflow, the more flooding there is downstream. The districts with the highest potential for flooding are Padangan, Kalitidu, Malo, Trucuk, Bojonegoro, Sumberejo, Kanor and Baureno. Figure 5.

High water discharge levels are common from November to April, the months when the study area is prone to flooding (see Figures 7 and 9). over the last three years the greatest discharge occurred in April 2013. In anticipation of flooding events, a levee was built along the river buffer in the district of Bojonegoro. The villages or sub-districts protected by the levee are Bojonegoro, Jetak, Klangon, Kauman, Ledok Kulon, Ledok Wetan and Banjarjo. The height of the embankment is different in every village, between 1–1.5 metres. The function of the levee is very poor in the sub-district of Bojonegoro, as the inhabitants open the levee to gain access from the unprotected areas to the protected city centre, e.g. entry point on Jendral Suprapto Street to Ledok Kulon sub-district. There are also open access points between the old and new levees. This poor functioning of the levees is mostly due to the inhabitants’ behaviour.

Existing flood-related policy in the research area Bojonegoro is located in the Bengawan Solo River watershed, which suffers from flood impacts, a decline in water quality, sedimentation and a density of settlements along the riverbanks. To anticipate the danger of flooding and periodic inundation, there is a conservation plan for flood-prone areas, which includes: 1. Preservation and cross-stream management areas 2. Building levees/dams/catchment areas/storm drains/other waterworks in watershed areas or areas prone to flooding, and efforts to reduce/control water discharge during emergencies 3. optimising the function of protected areas and water catchment areas 4. optimising riparian and channel functions to allow for more gradual flooding 5.

Eliminating factors that impede the drainage of surface water 8. Activating and coordinating management of drainage development with other regions 9. Preparing a masterplan review for both integrated flood control facilities and infrastructure, so that sewers are connected to networks of primary, secondary or tertiary sewers and not linked to irrigation drains. This will require coordination and synchronisation between the programme and provincial government and regional plans.

Houses were built during 1970–80 and the settlements have continued to grow along the river. Generally, almost 80 per cent of residents have homes built of permanent structures and just over 17 per cent have semi-permanent structures. Just over 3 per cent of houses are wooden (non-permanent). The settlement characteristics are investigated from two physical indices: building density and infrastructure. Almost 42 per cent of high-vulnerability areas have a building density of 17–29 houses/ha, and 25 per cent have a building density of 30–41 houses/ha. In medium-vulnerability areas, 40 per cent have a building density of 7–16 houses/ha. Just over a third of low-vulnerability areas have a building density of 17–29 houses/ha (33.33 per cent) while 80 per cent have a building density of 7–16 houses/ha, and 20 per cent have 0–6 houses/ha (Widayanti et al., 2012). This paper classifies the vulnerability of settlements based on infrastructure and physical condition, and social and economic conditions. The assumption is that the more infrastructure and facilities an area has, and the more an area serves as an access or transport node, the more vulnerable the population will be if this area is exposed to climate impacts such as floods. Therefore, an area is considered highly at risk and high-vulnerability if it has many essential services and infrastructure such as health centres and access roads affected by floods. Amongst the high-vulnerability areas, 40 per cent have a minimum of two important facilities, and 33.33 per cent have more than three. In the medium-vulnerability category, 53.33 per cent of settlements have two public facilities, and 13.33 per cent have no facilities. In the low-', '26 AsiAn Cities ClimAte ResilienCe vulnerability category, 40 per cent of areas have no facilities and 60 per cent have one public facility. For accessibility, in the high-vulnerability settlements, 40 per cent of roads are paved with stone and 20 per cent are asphalt. In areas of medium vulnerability, 60 per cent of roads are paved, 13.33 per cent are asphalt, and for the areas of low vulnerability 100 per cent of roads are paved. Figure 8.

It serves as a forum for dialogue and to encourage strong intellectual debate over concepts relating to urban resilience, results from the ground, and future directions. The series is also intended to encourage the development of local research capacity and to ensure local ownership of outputs. The series has arisen out of the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network (ACCCRN, www.acccrn.org), an initiative funded by the Rockefeller Foundation.

This method has been widely used in Thailand, not only to cope with floods, but also for renovating houses in rural areas. With this approach, without deconstructing the house, the pillars of the house are elevated by hydraulic jacks and restabilised at a higher level. The civil engineer officer of Pralab district municipality revealed that this method has been widely used by house owners, especially for old houses in Pralab suburb. The cost of elevating a house ranges between 8,500–30,000 Baht per house. This cost represents a considerable investment for poorer households, and therefore some households have borrowed money to elevate their houses to avoid flooding. However, since the elevation of old houses does not require official approval, there are no reliable records available. For new houses or commercial buildings, all projects use landfilling to elevate the earth above flood levels. This method requires official approval. Since the big flood of 2011, 456 units (houses) and 33 commercial buildings have been approved for construction and all of these have used landfilling to raise the earth, at least to the same level as the top of the nearby road (Civil Engineer Office 2015). The same civil engineer officer also expressed his concern regarding building long-term resilience. He noted that dyke construction along the Pra Keau natural waterway is necessary to prevent the overflow of polluted water drained from Khon Kaen urban zone into the Pralab area. Water pumps should be installed in flood-prone areas to drain water, and, for this, local government must support the cost of the electricity or gas to pump the water. From in-depth interviews with flood-affected households, the residents of Pralab apply a range of coping mechanisms when faced with floods. Individuals prepare necessities, such as medicine for household members with chronic illness, clothes and gumboots. Households have to move their belongings and appliances to higher levels to avoid water damage. If necessary, households build temporary shelters on roadsides or on public land that has escaped flooding (see Figure 5). There were two public spaces used for temporary shelters during the 2011 flood – ring roads and the village primary school. The number of households who built shelters on the roadside was 221, representing 50 per cent of the population of Ban Pra Keau, one of the villages of Pralab Tambon municipality. In the same year, 75 households used primary school buildings for their temporary shelters (Public Health Officer, interviews). During the floods, networks of kin or mutual support are essential for all kinds of help for households. Households who own boats prepare them to use as transportation during the floods. Some of the households earn and income from fishing during the floods. Apart from assistance in terms of food, clean drinking water and some necessities that affected people receive from government agencies, they also receive help from philanthropic organisations from Khon Kaen, particularly in the form of canned food and bottled drinking water. In-depth interviews were carried out with the Khon Kaen provincial health authority, the district health chief and two community health officers. They all reflected that Thailand has not yet put in place a national public plan and strategy to cope with climate change. The Thai Cabinet launched a resolution assigning the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) to lead on the development of a public health plan and strategy for adaptation to climate impacts in December 2012. At this point, the MOPH has just finished the first draft of the plan and strategy document, and this still needs consultation with other government agencies and the general public. The draft national public health and climate change adaptation plan and strategy focuses on establishing a public health surveillance system, information and communication network, developing climate and health training courses, and formulating a rapid response system to tackle health problems during extreme climatic events.', '26 AsiAn Cities ClimAte ResilienCe Interviews with the two heads of the community health centres in Pralab revealed that there were no resources from the provincial and district health authorities, particularly for the preparedness of the centres in handling the health impacts from climatic change. During the severe flood in 2011, the two health centres did their best by cooperating with village health volunteers to deliver health services at home for those residents who could not physically access the health centres. Most services provided at home were the supply of drugs and health advice for chronic patients and for any emergency cases. The centres had no environmental health resources to offer to affected residents, such as clean water, solid waste management systems, insect and rodent control, or even mobile latrines. Those displaced residents who stayed in the temporary shelter (221 households) lived mostly on packaged food, clean water and other essentials provided by many charity organisations in Khon Kaen City centre. The health officers also observed that many residents who remained at home during the floods were suffering from skin problems arising from contact with polluted waters, insufficient fresh food and water, the threat of poisonous animals, difficulties in disposing of garbage and human excreta, and difficulties in cleaning clothes and other houseware. Chronic patients became more stressful, and most residents feared that some of their assets would be lost, and therefore they did not want to leave their houses for temporary shelters on roadsides and in the primary school during the flood. Most children could not go to school, and many families could not access their workplaces in Khon Kaen City centre. The respondents from the health authorities at provincial, district, and community levels also revealed that they all expected the country to put in place a national public health plan and strategy in coping with climate change. They feel that once the plan and strategy had been established and approved by the Cabinet, then public health resources and other supporting measures would be available and eventually transferred to the level of the community health centres. The two community health centres also observed that the collapse of infrastructures; road, sewerage systems, public water supply systems, solid waste collection and transportation, were well-known as the social and environmental determinants of health. They were of the opinion that occurrences of diarrhoea and other communicable diseases in particular were more prevalent during the flooding period, and hence related to the floods. The provincial health authorities added more observations on the collaborating efforts between government agencies; they remarked that even the provincial government had set up a disaster relief committee, but for the health sector there was little cooperation with other sectors. The aid provided by public health and other services to displaced residents and those staying at their home during the flood, was mainly from local government, but with limited capacity - and therefore surprisingly a large part came from private agencies, in particular local charity groups and the provincial chamber of commerce. It is worthy to note here that social cohesion and social networks, as illustrated in Figure 4, have become a proactive and reliable group to fulfil the mission of helping the diverse affected population. This active civic movement for helping those impacted by floods has been triggered and stimulated by the local mass media as they disclosed information about the severe conditions to the general public. The results of the focus group discussions with the chronically ill patients revealed that they expected the health authorities to be better prepared to deal with extreme flood events. They reasoned that the elderly in Pralab with chronic hypertension and diabetes were struggling to get access to the health care services during flood events, while the health care providers could not do any physical check-ups at the health centre or do outreach home visits. They received some advice and drugs from village health volunteers instead, and this was not sufficient. These groups also experienced more stress during the floods. They suggested that provincial and district health providers should offer more healthcare services in the areas where floods were persistent, when the existing two to three health officers at the community centres could not handle the heavier load. Communication with the registered patients in the area was anoth\n",

I.! Introduction# Over the past several decades, a fragmented array of government programs has emerged to provide health care or health insurance for Americans. Several of these programs serve the veterans and military community, either directly or indirectly, including Department of Defense (DoD) medical care and health insurance, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care and disability compensation; Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), Medicare, and others. Over the past several decades, these programs each came into being separately. Consequently, they do not mesh cleanly, and cannot have their interactions easily fixed, because they fall under the jurisdiction of myriad agencies and Congressional oversight committees. This area’s complex political landscape makes reform even more difficult, because each program has large and politically powerful stakeholders. This working paper examines the overlap of these programs with respect to a specific sub- population: seriously wounded, ill and injured veterans who retire from active military service with disabilities so severe that they cannot work after leaving service. The web of government programs serving this population does not mesh well, creating challenges for veterans as they move between these programs. This set of problems has been described by stakeholders as the “TRICARE- Medicare trap,” which ensnares veterans and their family members who fail to perfectly navigate the system of benefits, potentially losing health coverage or incurring substantial costs and penalties, or both. To better understand this problem, this paper estimates the size of this population and some of its relevant characteristics, including levels of disability compensation. Next, this paper outlines the health choices facing this population after leaving service, including some of the dilemmas created by messy interplay of DoD, VA, SSDI, and Medicare programs. Finally, this paper concludes with several potential solutions for these issues, including: !! Improving data sharing and coordination among agencies, both to identify veterans and families that experience difficulty (and require assistance), and to identify macro-level policy issues that may arise in the future from this fragmented array of benefits programs. !! Decoupling TRICARE from Medicare for severely wounded, ill and injured retirees, such that the nation’s most severely disabled veterans do not have to opt into Medicare Part B in order to obtain TRICARE. !! Eliminating penalties for this category of veterans for delayed enrollment in Medicare Part B, or TRICARE, or vice-versa, creating a more forgiving health care system for this class of severely wounded, ill or injured veterans. !! Enabling movement between systems for veterans as their life circumstances change, such as when veterans return to work. !! Creating cost parity between health care systems such that the most severely wounded, ill or injured veterans do not pay more for their health care than ordinary DoD retirees using TRICARE, or non-retired veterans using the VA or Medicare for their health care. ! 2!', 'CNAS Working Paper: Improving Federal Programs to Support Seriously Wounded, Ill and Injured Veterans 3! ! II.! Background# A.! The Veterans and Military Population# The VA and Census Bureau estimated that there were approximately 21.4 million U.S. veterans in 2016, including all generations and segments of the veteran population.1 These veterans make up 6.6 percent of the total national population. In the aggregate, the current veterans population is an older, white, male population; its median age is approximately 64, and more than 90 percent of veterans are male. However, these demographics are changing. In 2015, Gulf War-era veterans overtook Vietnam-era veterans as the largest segment of the population. The post-9/11 cohort of veterans now numbers 2,874,820, including those who have deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan, or other theaters of war since 9/11.2 This makes the post-9/11 deployment cohort roughly equal in size to the number of veterans who served in Vietnam, and substantially larger than the number who served in Korea, although smaller than the number of veterans who served during both eras because the military itself is smaller.3 The active duty and reserve population make up an important part of the veteran community – both in terms of size and need, and because the military produces the veteran population of tomorrow. The current military population includes approximately 1.3 million active duty personnel in all four services, and 1.1 million active reservists spread among the various Guard and reserve elements. Military families represent an important part of the active military community, too. There are approximately 1.82 million dependents of active duty personnel, and another 682,000 dependents for active reserve personnel.4 DoD has primary authority for serving the active and reserve population and their families. Each year, at its current size, the active military takes in approximately 175,000 recruits, and discharges a similar number. The reserves turn over about half that number, with many of their recruits coming from active service. Of those military personnel leaving the service, approximately three quarters leave at the end of their service period, with little or no continuing eligibility for DoD benefits. The remaining quarter “retire” from military service, earning some type of DoD retirement pension as well as the lifetime provision of other benefits such as health insurance, base access, and commissary shopping privileges. Within this DoD retiree population, three quarters retire after 20 years (or more) of service; one quarter retire because of a medical reason that renders them ineligible for continued military service. The table below summarizes the annual turnover of the active duty military in FY2015, the last year for which complete data is available: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ! 1 Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Population (“VetPop”) data, 2014 update, projection for 2017; U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey. 2 Department of Defense, Contingency Tracking System data, as of May 2017. 3 Department of Veterans Affairs, “Fact Sheet: America’s Wars,” April 2015, available online at: http://www.va.gov/opa/publications/factsheets/fs_americas_wars.pdf. 4 Department of Defense, “Evaluation of the TRICARE Program: Access, Cost and Quality, Fiscal Year 2016 Report to Congress.” Note that the population of reserve dependents includes those reserve families who are eligible for DoD family benefits, including but not limited to TRICARE, because of their duty status or other reason.

Audrey Burnam, Lisa S. Meredith, Todd C. Helmus, Rachel M. Burns, Robert A. Cox, Elizabeth D’Amico, Laurie T. Martin, Mary E. Vaiana, Kayla M. Williams, and Michael R. Yochelson Introduction How can we best provide services for military personnel who are suffering from mental health and cognitive problems? The answer to that question is the focus of Chapter Seven. We examine the health care services available to military servicemembers who have returned from Afghanistan and Iraq with post-traumatic stress disorder or depres- sion, or who have suffered a traumatic brain injury during their deployment. We also examine gaps in these services, with the goal of supporting efforts to meet the mental health and cognitive needs of returning OEF/OIF servicemembers and veterans. We consider two kinds of service gaps: gaps in access to care and gaps in quality of care. A gap in access exists when many individuals who need services are not using them. Many factors can contribute to underuse of services. Following a conceptual model commonly used in health services research (Institute of Medicine, 1993), we organize the contributing factors into two broad domains: (1) structural and finan- cial aspects of the health service systems (e.g., eligibility rules, financial incentives, availability of services) and (2) personal and social factors (e.g., individual values and beliefs, military culture) (see Figure 7.1). These factors can be either barriers, reducing the probability of service use, or facilitators, increasing use. Eliminating gaps in access to care will increase use of ser- vices among those who might benefit from the services. 245', '246 Invisible Wounds of War Figure 7.1 Health Care Systems Improve Health Outcomes by Facilitating Access to Services That Provide High-Quality Care Access barriers or facilitators Use of services High-quality care Outcomes Structural/financial 7JTJUT &GGFDUJWF )FBMUI TUBUVT t &MJHJCJMJUZ 1SPDFEVSFT 4BGF \\'VODUJPOJOH t \\'JOBODJOH JODFOUJWFT 1SFTDSJQUJPOT t \"WBJMBCJMJUZ 1BUJFOU DFOUFSFE 4PDJBM DPOTFRVFODFT 1FSTPOBM TPDJBM 5JNFMZ t 7BMVFT BOE BUUJUVEFT &GmDJFOU t .JMJUBSZ DVMUVSF &RVJUBCMF RANDMG720-7.1 A gap in quality exists when the services that individuals typically receive are not consistent with high-quality care. Following the Institute of Medicine’s Quality Chasm reports (Institute of Medicine, 2001, 2006), we define high-quality care as care that is t based on the best available evidence and expert consensus about what is most effective t safe (the expected health benefit is higher than the expected health risk) t patient-centered, meaning that the values and preferences of individuals are respected in clinical decisionmaking and that patients are fully informed partici- pants in decisions about their treatment t timely (delays that might be harmful to health are avoided) t efficient (waste of resources is avoided) t equitable (care does not vary by gender, ethnicity, geographic location, etc.). Eliminating gaps between high-quality care and usually practiced care will improve health outcomes among those who use services. Figure 7.1 highlights that health outcomes are a function of access to care that results in use of services and receipt of high-quality care in the course of using those services. Thus, maximizing the benefits of health care services requires simultaneously facilitating access to services and ensuring that the services received are of high quality. Providing access to services that are not effective or that have unknown effectiveness may have little or no positive effect on outcomes, and they may incur costs to both the systems and the individuals who use services. Similarly, high-quality clinical care will have limited effect on outcomes if access to this care is poor for the broader population of those who would be expected to benefit from it.', 'Systems of Care: Challenges and Opportunities to Improve Access to High-Quality Care 247 There are many challenges to facilitating good access to services and ensuring high quality of care for mental and cognitive health. These challenges exist across the U.S. health care system and thus are not unique to the systems of care designed to serve military servicemembers and veterans. Access and Quality Challenges Epidemiologic studies of the general U.S. adult population show that, among individu- als likely to have experienced a mental disorder in the past year, six in ten do not use any health care services for their mental health problems. Of the four in ten who do use services, only about half of these receive care from a mental health specialist (Wang, Lane, et al., 2005). Good access to mental health care in the United States has long been hampered by limited mental health benefits in employer-sponsored health insurance and by cost- constrained publicly funded services that provide access to the most severely disabled but have limited resources for serving a broader array of problems and populations. Other long-standing barriers to access include poor availability of specialty mental health services in rural areas and the difficulties of developing capacities to provide language and culturally appropriate services for the diversity of Americans. Thanks to advocacy, education, and growing public awareness, social and per- sonal barriers to access—including the stigma associated with being viewed as having a mental disorder and public attitudes and misunderstandings about mental health con- ditions and their treatments—have lessened over time. However, these attitudes still significantly affect the willingness of individuals to consider and seek care for mental health problems. Studies that have examined the discrepancy between typical health care received by Americans and high-quality, evidence-based care inevitably find a striking gap, not only for care of mental disorders but for care of many other medical conditions. In a large study of adult populations of 12 metropolitan areas of the country, researchers found that, among those with major depression, about six in ten who used any health services received recommended care—that is, care meeting standards of professionally accepted practice guidelines (McGlynn et al., 2003). Similar findings were reported for stroke, coronary artery disease, and asthma. So large and pervasive is this gap that it is often termed the “Quality Chasm” by health policy and services researchers, after the title of a seminal report published by the Institute of Medicine in 2001. The failure to provide high-quality care is, by and large, not a problem of health professionals being uncaring or incompetent; rather, poor quality often stems from multiple and complex failures involving the policy and regulatory environment, coor- dination among multiple and complex systems of care, the organization of the health care facility and its staff, information systems, interactions between professionals and patients, and financial incentives that have perverse effects on quality at all levels— from patient to system (Berwick, 2002).', '248 Invisible Wounds of War Barriers to access and failures to provide high-quality care are challenges that con- front health care and mental health care systems generally. However, American leaders, the Department of Defense (DoD), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and the public concur that military servicemembers who have served in Afghanistan and Iraq should receive care of the highest quality. Americans want the nation’s servicemembers and their families to have good access to appropriate and high-quality health care for service-related mental health and cognitive problems—both during their active duty service and after they have returned to civilian life. With political will galvanized to improve care for mental health conditions and traumatic brain injury for American servicemembers, there is an historic opportunity for transformation that can facilitate access to and improve quality of care. But the magnitude of the challenges should not be underestimated. Mandates that assume quick, simple solutions to these complex problems are unlikely to significantly affect the bottom line—more servicemembers getting care that helps them recover from their mental health and cognitive conditions—even when there is some satisfaction to seeing things happen quickly. Lessons from the broader health services field suggest that a sustained systems approach will be required to make significant advances in care. Such an approach would encompass a broad perspective—from policy environment, to organization of the delivery of care, to patient-therapist interaction—concerning the policy levers that can drive change. This broad perspective would also point toward sustained investment in an information infrastructure that can support continuous assessment and evalu- ation and would engender an organizational environment and culture that can learn from experience and strive toward improvements.

Once a large producer of oil and gas, declining reserves have increased import dependency in recent years. A large energy infrastructure exists due to the historical reliance on gas for heating and high level of electri- fication. The changing economy and energy system have led to three key energy policy issues emerging over the last 10 years: energy security, affordability, and system decarbonization. The case for deep decarbonization of the UK energy system was first made in a landmark report by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution in 2000,1 which proposed a vol- untary 60% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050, recognizing the serious challenge of climate change.

Introduction The projected annualised costs for combating climate change run into figures of hundreds of billions of dollars (Newell, 2008). Encouraging innovation and use of low-carbon technologies aims to reduce these costs and increase the positive spill-overs into other sectors of the economy. The UNFCCC dialogue on long-term cooperative action to address climate change emphasizes the role for international cooperation to support technology R&D and deployment, with the intention of reducing the cost of technology and ensuring its widespread application (UNFCCC 2007). The necessary technologies for carbon abatement range across energy transformation, renewable power, energy efficiency and carbon capture. Global efforts to develop and deploy these technologies on the scale required for stabilised GHG concentrations depend on the pursuit of two dimensions: • Continued innovation in existing and emerging low-carbon technologies to improve their performance and manufacturing processes, and to adapt it to national circumstances • Ensuring widespread use of low-carbon technologies, including developing the regulatory framework and complementary infrastructure for manufacturing, operation, maintenance, project management and financing. The paper combines academic frameworks, illustrative examples, and a novel patent dataset to explore the possible trade-offs between these objectives and identify complementarities arising globally between innovation, adoption and use of energy technologies. Four objectives (illustrated in Figure 1) for policy design to support low-carbon technologies are emerging: First, any new technology has to be sold on national markets, and is therefore dependent on the capacity of these markets to manufacture, install, operate and use the technology. This absorptive capacity grows with the production and use of low-carbon technologies. Robust domestic policies are required to support growing use of low-carbon technology in conjunction with the evolution of regulatory and pricing structures that open the opportunities for economy-wide application of new technologies. International support can augment this process, address barriers, provide resources, and create confidence to encourage domestic and international investment. Complementing policies and technical cooperation can enhance the necessary skills, provide training, develop the institutional setting and grow the domestic supply chain to deal with complex technologies. Second, innovation is required to adapt the technology to domestic needs, thus ensuring that technologies are viable in national and local conditions. Resources and capacities in the manufacturing sector are required for local adoption and adaptation of internationally available technologies. An international network of innovation centres can support these domestic innovative activities. These networks can provide an initial stimulus to increase domestic market demand and further domestic policies, to create the necessary regulatory, institutional and financial background for new technologies and concepts. Third, experiences from different national applications of a technology enrich the technology choices available internationally. International cooperation can accelerate the accumulation of experience, with opportunities for cost-sharing, knowledge-sharing, coordination on standards to facilitate compatibility of technology components, and frameworks that facilitate licensing. Thus access to multiple national schemes can give 2', 'International Support for Domestic Climate Policies technology companies the confidence to invest in innovation, as a larger market is less exposed to the policy and regulatory uncertainty of individual governments. Fourth, investors and innovators are assured by credible technology policies with shared visible low-carbon and social objectives. Increased experience with technology policy, international cross-fertilisation, and changing governments will result in a continued evolution of national policies and frameworks. If there is a commitment to the overall policy objectives, successful low-carbon and energy efficiency technologies and projects will continue to find market opportunities, irrespective of the specific policy choice. International processes can enhance this commitment by providing support and allowing national governments to make public commitments. Innovation Use 1. Growing local 4. Committing 2.

Creating multiple experiences to drive innovation Figure 1. Innovation Chain: International Synergies and Use This paper builds on the broader framework of the innovation chain that traces the development path of a technology, or technological component, from conception to widespread diffusion. Grubb (2004) suggests that the innovation process can be usefully thought of in terms of several key development stages. Research and development is typically followed by some gradual move into demonstration projects or prototypes. The subsequent commercialisation phase provides market experience to tailor the product to consumer demand, explore smart ways of manufacturing the product and accumulate experience and production scale to reduce costs. This can ultimately generate the right conditions for widespread deployment and diffusion of the product. Figure 2Figure 2 illustrates that movement along the innovation chain is determined by synergies between different stages of the process. Experience during demonstration, commercialisation and diffusion guides research and development, which can trigger new demonstration and subsequent commercialisation of the improved process or technology in a virtuous circle. 3 CCoouunnttrryy BB CCoouunnttrryy AA', 'International Support for Domestic Climate Policies E x per i ence to guide/select innovation activities Re searc h & D emonstration Commercialisation Dif fusion D ev el opm ent Innovation Use Pro f i ts and markets to incentivise innovation Figure 2.

Introduction Drawing on experiences from indicator frameworks across a variety of countries, regions and sectors, the paper discusses lessons emerging from applications of indicators for performance benchmarks, international comparisons and domestic policy design. This paper reviews experience with indicators to explore the role metrics can play in informing and supporting climate policy and enhance reporting under the UNFCCC National Communications. The paper focuses on the role of intermediate indicators as output metrics from an action or process that can be used as a tool to support policy implementation or facilitate performance- benchmarks. Intermediate indicators can be useful as part of internal or domestic information gathering and presentation for strategy and policy learning. They can enable the adoption of best practice and provide a framework for support and cooperation incorporating transparency, comparability and accountability. Indicators need not be linked to policy objectives or targets to generate learning and improved policy success; informative indicators can facilitate better policy design, ongoing assessment and updating. The challenges of climate policy require the unprecedented transformation of our energy systems and our economies to deliver growth and prosperity alongside stabilised global greenhouse gas concentrations. Whilst overall emission reductions must occupy a central part of efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change, for developing countries the need for policies and measures to deliver economic growth in a sustainable manner takes priority. The challenge for policy making lies in effective implementation and decisive policies and measures that can be assessed and tracked to ensure public/investor confidence in policy realisation. Transparency, accountability and comparability of efforts are important for assessing global actions and for prioritising international support for developing countries. Overall emissions stabilisation as the long-term objective for global climate policy will be met through a succession of policies and measures over shorter time horizons. This paper investigates evidence from other policy fields to inform the design of intermediate indicators to measure and monitor the success of policies and actions. Indicators can make a critical contribution to transparency in measuring (and delivering) policy success in addition to leveraging and prioritising effective international cooperation and support. An example of an intermediate indicator for climate policy might be a measure of Verified Emission Reductions arising from projects under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). However other lead-indicators, incorporating implicit carbon-reduction impacts, such as MW installed supercritical coal capacity, energy efficiency appliance standards or rural electrification rates, allow for a greater degree of specificity and flexibility in the measurement of success of actions that may not be exclusively climate-focused. At present quantification of national actions are not required as part of National Communications or National Inventory Reporting (only Annex I parties), and even the required greenhouse gas emissions reporting is often partial and based on non-comparable methodologies. There is renewed focus on the contribution of indicators to fulfil measurement, reporting and verification commitments of parties under the United Nations Framework Convention on 3', 'International Support for Domestic Climate Policies Climate Change (UNFCCC) as defined in the Bali Action Plan. The decision sets in motion the development of “measurable, reportable and verifiable nationally appropriate mitigation commitments or actions, including quantified emission limitation and reduction objectives, while ensuring the comparability of efforts among them, taking into account differences in their national circumstances” (UNFCCC 2007). A clear metric of success is in the interests of all parties; creating opportunities for learning, sharing of best practice, cooperation and policy setting. This paper draws on experiences with performance metrics and intermediate indicators across countries at the sectoral, national and international levels. This provides insights on the process by which such metrics may be selected, measured and reported. This paper explores the theoretical and practical issues in development, implementation and effectiveness of intermediate indicators across a variety of non-climate change applications and sectors. We do not address indicators linked to explicit policy targets which are explored elsewhere in the project (Neuhoff and Lester 2008) and focus instead on five other indicator experiences where indicators serve as benchmarks or informative metrics for policy debate, design and assessment. Indicator-systems that include intermediate indicators are examined through experiences with the development of OECD Science, Technology and Innovation indicators (STIs) and the EU Agri- Environmental indicators (AEIs). Experience of performance metrics is drawn from the construction industry, with focus on the use of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in the UK. For experiences with policy indicators we examine recent innovations in the use of intermediate indicators for overseas development assistance in sub-Saharan Africa, specifically the European Commission’s Special Programme for Africa (SPA). 2. Review of Indicator Methodology and Practice Indicators are defined by the OECD as “a parameter (a property that is measured or observed), or a value derived from parameters (index) which points to, provide information about, describe the state of a phenomenon, with significance extending beyond that direct associated with a parameter value” (OECD 1998). Indicator terminology typically adopts a systems view, focusing on inputs, outputs and outcome measures, or alternatively pressure-state-response1 and impact metrics. Applications of intermediate indicators broadly fall under two different approaches; indicator systems and performance-based indicators. The former involves an indicator framework or hierarchy, whereby indicators are chosen to capture different aspects of a process or set of processes. The body of literature on indicator systems is extensive ranging from methodology through to implantation practice, for further detail see Boland and Fowler (2000) and Brignall and Modell (2000) Performance-based indicators typically focus on outcome indicators only for use in benchmarking, performance-related pay or policy making. Performance indicator applications include use for results based management (Black and White 2004; Heinrich 2002; 1An indicator framework designed to measure and reflect the pressures of human activities, the state of human and natural systems and the responses of society to changes in those systems. 4', 'Intern\n",

The clean energy transition will create challenges: as fossil fuel production and consumption decline, governments will need to rethink how they raise revenue from fossil fuels and diversify their revenue base to replace them. Addressing this challenge is not, however, insurmountable. Governments can implement the following policies to secure their financial position during the clean energy transition. Recommendations: 1. Evaluate and report on the flows of government revenues and subsidies related to fossil fuels. Governments should improve transparency by reporting on the scale and type of revenues received from, and subsidies provided to, fossil fuel production and consumption. Subsidy reporting can involve voluntary peer reviews at the national level, under the G20 and reporting on SDG indicator 12.c.1. This will help offer insights to governments in undergoing a fiscal transition away from fossil fuels. 2. Support economic diversification away from fossil fuel dependency. Diversification can shield governments from the risk of falling fossil fuel revenues. All BRICS governments should support economic diversification and the diversification of their energy sectors to mitigate energy transition impacts. In particular, Russia’s national economy is heavily dependent on fossil fuels and would benefit from diversification, as would the subnational coal-producing regions in China, India and South Africa, and oil-producing Rio de Janeiro State in Brazil. Support for economic diversification and diversification of the energy mix necessitates: a) Phasing out fossil fuel subsidies and public finance for fossil fuels. b) Ensuring polluters pay for negative impacts, such as on health and climate, which will create a clear price signal to promote the transition to clean energy. Fossil fuel and carbon taxes play a key role in this respect. c) Reinvesting revenues from fossil fuel production and consumption and savings from subsidy reform into productive uses, such as sustainable infrastructure, education and health. d) Harnessing SOEs and public finance institutions, such as the New Development Bank, as vehicles of diversification for the clean energy transition. e) Targeting support for low-income households (cash transfers, improved social safety nets, etc.) to counteract negative impacts from subsidy removal. f) Ensuring support for a just transition for workers and communities depending on fossil fuels. 7. Ensure fiscal revenue diversification. In the short-to-medium term, the likely pathway for energy transition is for governments to start removing fossil fuel subsidies and increasing taxes on fossil fuels and carbon, in order to price fossil fuels more rationally. All countries, including BRICS, are recommended to ensure that such revenues are well managed but are not seen as a long-term strategy for broadening the tax base. Rather, revenues from fossil fuels, including from emerging carbon pricing, should be used as a temporary bridge to help fund the costs IISD.org/gsi 19', 'Beyond Fossil Fuels: Fiscal transition in BRICS of transition, including mitigating their negative impacts on vulnerable energy consumers and developing programs for a just transition for communities and workers. A fiscal transition and diversifying government revenues away from fossil fuels will help ensure greater coherence on sustainable economies, energy efficiency and security, clean air and climate action in BRICS countries.

Estimates of fossil fuel reserves have been sourced from BP (2019b) for consistency; country’s own estimates may differ. * The carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) of reserves was calculated assuming their eventual business-as-usual combustion with the following emission factors: 0.39 tCO2e per barrel of oil, 58.82 tCO2e per million cubic feet of gas, 2.64 tCO2e per tonne of anthracite or bituminous coal and 1.34 tCO2e per tonne of subbituminous coal or lignite. These factors are based on standard carbon contents as reported by BP (2019a) and triangulated with Eggleston, Buendia, Miwa, Ngara, & Tanabe (2006, Section 1.4.2.) and IEA (2005) with an adjustment for non-energy uses based on Heede (2014).

IISD.org/gsi 26', 'Beyond Fossil Fuels: Fiscal transition in BRICS Executive Summary The group of countries known as BRICS—Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa—is both influencing and being influenced by global energy markets and the clean energy transition. For BRICS, like all other countries, the clean energy transition is being driven by both external and domestic factors: international climate commitments, plummeting costs of renewables and domestic needs to improve energy efficiency as well as to reduce local air pollution. Large energy importers such as China and India also benefit from domestic generation from renewable sources as a way of decreasing their dependence on imports and improving energy security and trade balance. China and India already invest more in solar and wind than in fossil fuel-based power (International Energy Agency [IEA], 2019a). This report focuses, for the first time, on a specific aspect of the clean energy transition for BRICS: its consequences for government budgets. Based on the BRICS governments’ own reporting, we estimate that, in 2017, taxes and other revenues from both fossil fuel production and consumption amounted to the following shares of general government revenue:1 23.6 per cent (8 per cent of GDP) in Russia, 17.8 per cent (3.7 per cent of GDP) in India, 6.8 per cent (2 per cent of GDP) in Brazil, 6.8 per cent (1.9 per cent of GDP) in South Africa and 4.2 per cent (1.2 per cent of GDP) in China (see Figures 6 and 7 in Section 3 and individual country briefs for more detail). Some of these revenues fluctuate with fossil fuel prices on the world markets. Therefore, the clean energy transition and the ensuing decrease in demand for fossil fuels over the longer term can affect the revenue base for the BRICS governments in two ways: through a drop in fossil fuel prices and through the shrinkage of absolute amounts of fossil fuel production and consumption. Meanwhile, the revenue base is already being eroded by subsidies to both fossil fuel production and consumption. According to the estimates of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), these subsidies amounted to the following shares of general government revenue: 2.4 per cent (0.7 per cent of GDP) in South Africa, 2 per cent (0.4 per cent of GDP) in India, 1.5 per cent (0.5 per cent of GDP) in Russia, 1.1 per cent (0.3 per cent of GDP) in Brazil, and 0.5 per cent (0.1 per cent of GDP) in China (OECD, 2019). In addition, the IEA identifies even larger subsidies to fossil fuel consumption in BRICS (IEA, 2019c) (see Figures 6 and 7 in Section 3). Coal, oil and gas producers may pressure governments for subsidies even more as they seek to remain competitive in light of the clean energy transition. Economic models suggest that the clean energy transition has an overall neutral or beneficial effect on the global economy, but it also leads to losses for fossil fuel-producing segments of the economy (UN Env\n",

One of the biggest awards for Casisas was Mayor Hickenlooper’s proclamation of Friday, Nov. 19 2004 as “Matthew D. Casias Day.” Hickenlooper said, “Casias was a hero, an example of what a good citizen should be.” Casias was very happy and over- whelmed by the appreciation and support from the community. : “I feel good right now. I'm recovering day by day and I’m trying to believe this is happening because I know many good peo- ple. It feels good to know there are many good people out there. What happened that afternoon was simple; when I see somebody in need, I want to help. I just did. what comes natural to me. I would like to think there are other good people in the world who will also do the right thing to help others,” he said.

Salazar received the Partners with the Community Award from the National Conference for Community and Justice (NCCJ). Earlier the same day, Senator John Edwards (D-NC) expressed his support for Salazar. During the 76th anniversary of the NCCJ, an organization that fights for human rights and against discrimination, Salazar received his award from the event co-chair, Sharon Vigil, of Vigil & Associates, in recognition for his social respon- sibility and his daily efforts to improve the community. Salazar thanked the people in attendance and emphasized the need to continue the fight against discrimination. The emcee for the event was Sam Adams, sports writer for the Denver Post, who shared funny sto- ries of his career. The other awards were for Matthew Lynett, president of Wells Fargo Bank-Metro Denver, for his “leadership, vision, deep commit- ment to equality, valuing respect and understanding in the commu- nity and outstanding servise,” and James “Jimmy” Lustig of HC Companies, who received the Father C.B. “Woody” Woodrich Humanitarian Award for his “gen- erosity, outstanding commitment and caring and demonstrated serv- ice to the community.” “Partners With Community celebrates partnerships that strengthen and empower our rapid- ly growing diverse communities,” said Joyce Bignell, NCCJ executive director.

The idea of the market started 20 years ago, but with the leadership of Stella Yu, the mercado became a reality. : “There are many reasons I believe the com- munity needs this project. I think it will change and improve the neighborhood, helping many low-income families,” Yu said. The mercado offers crafts, food, art and entertainment from different cultures and eth- nic groups.

Progresan escuelas públicas en Colorado FRANCISCO MIRAVAL Un informe oficial del Departamento de Educación de Colorado, indica que los alumnos hispanos en la escuelas públicas de este estado están “en una teñ- dencia positiva de mejoría”. El llamado “Informe de Responsabilidad Escolar” (School Accountability Report) muestra que un 70'por cientodelasescue: las que en el 2001 habían sido cali- ficadas como “insatisfactorias” este año han obtenido mejores cal- ificaciones. En esta estas escue- las, la mayoría de las cuales está en Denver, donde más de la mitad del estudiantado es de origen his- pano. “Vemos que hay un progreso, especialmente en aquellas escue- las que hace un año identificamos como las que más desafíos pre- sentaban”, comentó en rueda de _ prensa el Gobernador Bill Owens. “”La mejor noticia es que 11.000 estudiantes :que el año pasado habían sido aplazados este año fueron aprobados”. “Pero a pesar de este progre- so, no todo es color de rosa”, sos- tuvo el mandatario. “Todavía hay 49 escuelas insatisfactorias en el CONTINUA PAGINA 9 e Public schools show progress A recent report from the Colorado Department of Education indicates that fewer students are attending “unsatisfactory” schools. In fact, the 2002- School Accountability Reports (SAR) reveals that 70 percent of the schools that received “unsatisfacto- ry” ratings in 2001 have improved and moved out of that category this year. “We are seeing progress, espe- cially among those schools identi- fied a year ago as facing the most significant challenges. These reports explode the tired old myth that high standards and accounta- bility can't work for troubled schools. The best news is that today we have 11,000 fewer stu- dents attending unsatisfactory schools as compared to a year ago,” Govenor Bill Owens said last Thursday, when he and Commissioner of Education William Moloney released the report. All five high schools that received unsatisfactory ratings last year have improved, while six of the seven middle schools have improved. Of the 18 elementary schools rated unsatisfàctory, ten have moved up including five which showed “significant” improvement. : Of the 21 schools that moved out of the unsatisfactory category, two-thirds are from the Denver Public School system, where 53 percent of the 73,000 students are of Hispanic origin. “The men and women of Denver Public Schools have shown us real improvement is possible in a major urban school system. Instead of looking for excuses after last year’s report, tħey accepted the challenge and pushed for change. Their efforts clearly paid off,” Owens said. Statewide, 40 schools received the Governors Distinguished Improvement Award this year. These are schools that received a rating of low or unsatisfactory last year and demonstrated significant improvement in their scores this year. Included in the 40 are ten high schools, seven middle schools and 23 elementary schools.

According to this committee, the take- over is a transfer of community assets to a private company for personal gain. The arrangement and services Sibling Entertainment is proposing to offer west Denver residents are insufficient for and incompatible with maintaining nonprofit sta- tus for the Denver Civic Theatre. The “Civic Belongs to the Westside” committee also makes the following allega- tions: Former board members of Denver Civic Theatre Incorporated (DCTI) have vio- lated their governing and fiduciary responsi- bility by means of infringement on the fol- lowing nonprofit statutes: • Conflict of interest + Failure to uphold the nonprofit articles of incorporation * Self-Inurement • Disregard of fiduciary responsibility In exchange for a payment (disguised as contribution) to DCTI of a reported $250,000, Sibling Entertainment, a for-profit New York corporation, with the support of the immedi- ate former board of directors will move to capture the assets of a nonprofit entity. Sibling Entertainment seeks to capitalize on considerations given to a charitable organiza- tion as a public trust. More specifically: ° Sibling has purchased positions on the nonprofit DCTI Board of Directors and has placed its partners and employees in thøse positions. ° Nonprofit board positions cannot be purchased. This represents an affront to any concept of public accountability. • Sibling has announced its intention to sell the Denver Civic Theatre building, the principle asset of the nonprofit, to a private Limited Liability Company made up of investors, hand-picked by members of the board and Sibling. The transaction proposed by Sibling envisions that the nonprofit DCTI will be heavily mortgaged. Further plans allow the LLC to eventually resell the building for a sub- stantial profit, and leave the DCTI nonprofit and the people of Denver with little or noth- ing. Members of the committee include Veronica Barela, of NEWSED; Anthony Garcia, of El Centro Su Teatro, Lisa Flores, of Inner City Parish and spokesperson for the group, and attorney Adrienne Benavidez. The committee hopes to have an initial answer in ten days.

Dirigentes de Denver buscan rescatar teatro comunitario FRANCISCO MIRAVAL Prominentes dirigentes latinos de Denver se presentaron ante las autoridades locales y estatales, pidiendo que se investigue y \"eventualmente se anule la venta de un teatro ubicado en el corazón del barrio his- pano en el oeste de esta ciudad. El Denver Civic Theater (DCT), fundado hace 80 años y tradicionalmente uno de los lugares más accesibles para familias latinas, fue recientemente vendido por la ciudad de Denver a una empresa de Nueva York, sin que la comunidad hispana participase del proce- s0. Aunque la venta ya está consumada, los miembros del Comité “Civic Belongs to Westside” insisten que la transacción viola leyes federales y estatales, así como ordenan- zas municipales, al transformar una organi- zación no lucrativa en otra dedicada a obtener ganancias. Peor aún, existen indicaciones que miembros anteriores y actuales de la mesa directiva del DCT se beneficiarían económicamente con la venta. “Creemos que hay suficiente evidencia como`para que la Ciudad de Denver, la fiscalía de distrito, las autoridades del Distrito Cultural y Científico de Denver, la procu- raduría de justicia de Colorado y el Servicio de Impuestos Internos de EEUU inicien una investigación”, dijo Lisa Flores, portavoz del comité. “Esperamos que en diez días por lo menos dos de estas agencias hayan iniciado sus averiguaciones”. El desacuerdo fundamental radica, según Flores, en que la propuesta presentada por Sibling Entertainment Inc (SETI) incluye la eventual venta del teatro, luego de renovarlo. La venta se realizaría, dice la propuesta, para devolverle el dinero a los inversores. Y esos inversores son los directivos de SEI, quienes a su vez se nombraron a ellos mismos como miembros de la mesa directiva del teatro: El precio de compra se estableció en $1,3 millones. El teatro renovado podría venderse entre $5 y $6 millones. “Nuestros asesores legales nos dicen que se trataría de una actividad incompatible con el estatus de DCT como organización sin fines de lucro. Como mínimo, existe un conflicto de interés, pero creemos que podría haberse viò- lado el Acta Revisada de Colorado para Organizaciones Sin Fines de Lucro “, dijo Flores. “Y no solamente n\n",

Cordesman Working Draft: August 26, 2020 Please provide comments to acordesman@gmail.com Photo: ABBAS MOMANI/AFP via Getty Images', 'Cordesman: Greater MENA Country Rankings 8/26/20 AHC 2 The Greater Middle East: From the “Arab Spring” to the “Axis of Failed States” Anthony H. Cordesman We have come a long way from the hopes associated with Camp David, “Globalism,” “the end of history,” the end of the First Gulf War in 1991, and the first year of the Arab Spring in 2011 – almost all of it in the wrong direction. From a “realist” perspective, the greater Middle East has deteriorated over time, and in ways that go far beyond its conflicts, its competing ideologies and faiths, and the petty power struggles of its ruling elites. The Burke Chair at CSIS is releasing an analysis of the progress the government of each county in the Middle East North Africa (MENA) region has actually made since 2011. This analysis ranks each country’s level of success or failure in meeting the needs of its people, and in meeting the hopes of the Arab Spring, in order to assess its current situation and provide a prognosis of its near term future. The results are not good. Far too many countries have become “failed states” in ways that go beyond the threat posed by Iran, extremism, and ethnic and sectarian divisions. They have failed to make adequate progress in civil and economic reforms, and they have stopped short of reducing corruption and incompetence in national politics and governance. Accordingly, it is time to take a hard, blunt look at what has happened to country-after-country in the region. Their governments have failed to make adequate progress in civil and economic reforms, and they have stopped short of reducing corruption and incompetence in national politics and governance. These problems are not specific to any one nation. They have become regional – made worse in virtually every case by the impact of the crisis in petroleum export prices and the Coronavirus on the local and global economy. Looking at the Real Causes of Failure It may seem a bit brutal to illustrate failure by scoring the level of failure in each country in the region – essentially highlighting its worst defects – and it is inevitably somewhat unfair by ignoring the fact that the level of “failure” is not all that different from the levels of failure in large parts around the rest of the world. The United States could easily be classed as a Category A to Category B failed state by the standards used in this analysis for its failure to achieve lasting results from its long wars, for its lack of progress in dealing with racism, and for the scale of its failures to use its wealth to deal with inequities in income. The EU would score just as badly for its failures relative to its opportunities, and both China and Russia have drifted into levels of authoritarianism that would push their ratings down much further to Category D or Category E. It is time, however, to look beyond terrorism, extremism, and Iran’s hardline politics. These are all real issues, as are the near-term humanitarian problems caused by the conflicts and power struggles in countries like Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. At the same time, far too much of the analysis of the greater Middle East focuses on only the immediate issues of one country or group of countries; on the current threat from “terrorism” and “extremism”; and on the threat from Iran, the Israeli-Palestinian issue, or the latest national political and economic crisis.', 'Cordesman: Greater MENA Country Rankings 8/26/20 AHC 3 Far too often, the importance of other factors is ignored – as is the behavior and status of most or all of the countries in the region. As is the case in the rest of the world, this leads to false hopes and dysfunctional efforts at finding real solutions. These hopes are compounded in many cases by assuming that the latest reform plan will actually be implemented and be successful in spite of long historical evidence indicating that such reform – and most changes in leadership – fail or fall far short of their announced goals. This tendency to ignore the key causes of failure in a given state is compounded when the scale and impact of ethnic, sectarian, and tribal discrimination and violence is largely ignored; when divided nations are treated as if they were unified; and when only national averages for economic and civil development are examined. The same is true when national gross domestic product (GDP) and per capita incomes are estimated using the purchasing power parity (PPP) method in spite of economic change, urbanization, and a shift to real market price. It is also true when gross corruption and poor distribution of income is ignored or when countries report more favorable data or no data at all. It is also true when budgets disguise the true scale of national security spending and the actual size of the allocation of resources to power elites or a given section of a nation’s population. Far too many national statistics are rough estimates or politicized. Unemployment and health data are particularly unrealistic, as is reporting on the treatment of foreign labor. Reporting on polls of popular trust in governments, in the political process, in the security forces, in government services, and in merit-based employment is often deeply disturbing – as is the near indifference to population growth and the social impact of urbanization and economic change (although the work done by the UN Arab Development Reports on youth employment is a notable exception). Population pressure and demographics receive too little attention. Most populations are extremely young by global standards, and both the young and the elderly are exceptionally dependent on the number of people who are actually gainfully employed. It is worth noting that the U.S. Census Bureau estimates of population growth for the Greater Middle East as shown in this analysis demonstrates a rise from 112.7 million in 1950, to 411.4 million in 2000, and to 598.9 million in 2029 – in spite of war after war, political turmoil, and the creation of massive refugee populations.1 Virtually all of the countries in the Greater Middle East suffer from corruption and failed governance, from a failure to modernize and open up their economy, and from population pressure and acute problems in dealing with a “youth bulge” and lack of jobs. Authoritarian excess and human rights abuses are the rule, rather than the exception. Major inequalities in income distribution and by faith and ethnicity are all too common. Many countries in the region seem incapable of helping themselves. They have reached the point where outside aid tends to do more to prolong problems than solve them, and instead allows their problems to fester and grow – rather than lead to real progress and solutions. This become all too clear when one looks beyond the crisis of the day, month or year – and examines the ratings and longer term trends in the UN Arab Development Reports, IMF Article IV reports, World Bank “governance and ease of doing business” rankings, UN and other demographic data, reporting on corruption by Transparency International and other organizations. It becomes equally apparent when one examines public opinion polls, and the comparative data on human progress and conditions from UN, IMF, Work Bank, and CIA factbook reporting.', 'Cordesman: Greater MENA Country Rankings 8/26/20 AHC 4 Arms races and conflicts waste critical resource, and they create streams of casualties and refugees. The level of waste, failures in security operations, and excessive repression are highlighted in UN, U.S. State Department reporting, as well as in NGO human rights reporting by organizations like Amnesty International and the Human Rights Watch as well as in studies of internal tensions by groups like the Crisis Watch. The amount of excessive military and security spending is partly revealed in reporting by the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS), Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), and IHS Janes. The actual level of excessive spending and value for money in military security spending would be far clearer if there was reporting on all countries and equal reporting on internal security forces and efforts, covert operations, and monetary payments to other state and non-state actors. Ranking Each Country in the Greater Middle East The rankings that follow are rough working estimates that do address the full range of such issues and judge the government of each state by its actual progress over time, particularly since 2011. They include every country in the Middle East, and they reflect an attempt to summarize the collective impact of these long-term reasons for failure of a given country. They also present a variety of nation-by-nation ranking of each government by the UN, World Bank, and other bodies; show the high rate of population pressure in most countries; and demonstrate the relatively limited per capita income of many states – even if issues like income distribution and corruption are ignored. They are limited by the fact that they are subjective, only highlight a few points in each case, cannot as of yet address the lasting impact of the Coronavirus crisis, and are highly uncertain even from a relatively short-term prognosis for the next five years. At the same time, the last decade is a warning for most countries that their leadership has failed to meet the needs of its people, and that promises of progress and reform are rarely kept. The order in which states are shown is semi-geographic to give some picture of how the level of “failure” in any given state interacts with the levels in neighboring countries. Each country is ranked by its performance on an international scale. The rankings for the level of failure range from A to F, with F \n",

Aggrieved youth increasingly express their anger through fiery protests, street violence, and in some cases violent extremism. In response to this ongo- ing social unrest and terrorism, the Tunisian government has developed hard- line security policies, whose effects often exacerbate social tensions, political violence, and militancy. Breaking this vicious cycle requires Tunisia’s govern- ment to rethink its approach to the border regions. The State of Tunisia’s Fragile Borders • Many youth in Tunisia’s border regions have lost confidence in the demo- cratic transition and have developed feelings of deep frustration, anger, and hostility toward state authority. • Years of protests are hardening into demands for a new social contract that would produce a more equitable redistribution of state resources as well as a transparent and inclusive process to manage Tunisia’s natural resources. • The state’s inability or unwillingness to reform its modes of governance— as well as its tendency to attack and stigmatize protesters as troublemakers, smugglers and terrorists—has contributed to the growing politicization and radicalization of youth. • The prolonged disconnect between the state and Tunisia’s marginalized regions is dangerous, threatening to plunge the country into violence that could see the country slide back into repressive authoritarianism. Recommendations for Tunisian Authorities and the International Community • Acknowledge the border regions’ decades-long experiences of socio- economic discrimination and political abuse and validate their histori- cal figures, symbols, and contributions to Tunisia. If accompanied by a genuine regional development program, such gestures can contribute to reconciliation between the aggrieved periphery and the dominant eastern Mediterranean coast. • Support strategies that increase agricultural competitiveness, reform landownership, and improve the management of natural resources. 1', '2 | The Geographic Trajectory of Conflict and Militancy in Tunisia The investment of a fair portion of the profits from local resources into local projects can improve the livelihoods of local communities. • Reform the internal security apparatus and criminal justice sector, and design rehabilitation and reintegration programs for the hundreds of Tunisian fighters returning from foreign theaters of conflict. • Support and empower the work of the National Authority for the Fight Against Corruption (INLUCC) and the Truth and Dignity Commission. Reducing corruption, restoring justice, and providing compensation to victims of repression will bolster lasting and sustainable stability.', 'Introduction Social inequality and regional asymmetries are deepening the chasm between Tunisia’s restless periphery and its eastern Mediterranean coast, with the potential to undermine the country’s democratic transition. Tunisian coastal elites fear and misunderstand the bitter resentment in the border communities, making it harder to secure the country from continuing terrorist threats. The violent extremist groups based in these communities feed on a deep well of disillusionment with the democratic transition and prey on the growing sense of emasculation, disempowerment, and helplessness among Tunisian youth. The Tunisian government’s narrow focus on combating extremist ideology is distracting from addressing the real drivers of radicalization. Studies show that the lure of violent extremist groups, such as the self-proclaimed Islamic State, has more to do with the promise of empowerment and restored dig- nity than with ideology or religious conviction.1 Since the 2011 revolution, Tunisia has experienced an evolving array of security threats, particularly along the country’s fragile borders. This paper will evaluate Tunisia’s security-based approaches to border control and provide recommendations for addressing the dangerous divide between the youth in Tunisia’s border regions and the state. Dynamic Threat of Militancy Since the end of former president Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali’s authoritarian rule in January 2011, the Tunisian government has been playing catch up against a continually shifting terror threat. The Tunisian revolution greatly disrupted the security landscape, initially marked by political disorientation and regional upheaval. The postrevolutionary period provided disparate Salafi groups with a sudden opportunity to sow the seeds of another revolutionary movement in the soil of poor neighborhoods and allowed them to take advantage of the widespread disillusionment among the youth, particularly in the border regions. Salafists of every stripe came to the fore, but it was the so-called Salafi jihadists who most took advantage of the political transition. Powered by the release of hundreds of Salafists from prison and the return of several promi- nent sheikhs to Tunisia from their sanctuaries in Western Europe, they began spreading their roots in the poor and marginalized areas where state authority was lacking.2 One of the challenges that faced the Salafists was how to transform the het- erogeneous Salafi-jihadi networks into a fixed structure with a central authority and identified leadership. Many radical Salafists coalesced around the hardline 3', '4 | The Geographic Trajectory of Conflict and Militancy in Tunisia group Ansar al-Sharia in Tunisia (AST), founded in late April 2011 by former prisoner Seifallah Ben Hassine, known as Abu Ayadh. Abu Ayadh prioritized central control over the growth of Salafi jihadism, fearing counterproductive actions might hurt the movement.3 These concerns were quickly realized when the movement became mired in controversies over vigilante violence against art shows, mausoleums, and liquor stores.4 Despite claims by Abu Ayadh that Tunisia was no longer a land of jihad, Salafi proselytizing and violent discourse became increasingly combative toward other Tunisians whose lifestyles the Salafists rejected. The rise of this violence reached its culmination in September 2012 when raging mobs set fire to the U.S. embassy and the American Cooperative School of Tunis. Salafi vigilantism proved destructive to the movement as Tunisia’s main Islamist party, Ennahda, which led a governing coalition from October 2011 to January 2014, hardened its security approach, targeting AST’s struc- tures, grassroots organizations, and social activities. The tougher approach prompted the Salafi jihadists to shift their focus away from aggressive, some- times violent, proselytizing to directly challenging state authority and attack- ing its key institutions. By doing so, the Salafi jihadists hoped to weaken the credibility of the state security forces by proving to disgruntled Tunisians that their government was unable to stop the Salafi-jihadi attacks. This attrition strategy escalated in 2013, with a vicious cycle of provoca- tion, retaliation, and repression. Tunisia’s then prime minister, an Islamist named Ali Larayedh, blamed AST militants for the assassinations of two Tunisian political figures and the killings of several members of the security forces.5 Nationwide reprisal operations against suspected militants’ hideouts and safe houses revealed weapon caches for future attacks. In the midst of this escalating war between the state and AST, small and violent militant groups connected to al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) were upping the ante in the western regions bordering Algeria. After the classification of AST as a terrorist organization in August 2013 and the resultant massive security crack- down on the movement and its sympathizers, groups such as the Okba Ibn Nafaa Brigade (an AQIM affiliate) posit\n",

Throughout the rise and fall of the Muslim Brotherhood, authoritarian forces remained the key political players. Democratic alternatives have not capitalized on cracks in the system. Prospects for the Brotherhood’s political reintegration and a democratization of political Islam are bleak. As long as credible alternatives fail to gain traction, the old state will persist and Egypt’s central challenges will remain unresolved. Key Themes • Egypt is where it was before the 2011 uprising—revolutionary battle lines are being drawn over support for an old state characterized by a series of institutional fiefdoms that act in their own interests rather than in the national interest. • The Muslim Brotherhood’s rule constituted an undemocratic interlude in Egyptian politics, and its downfall was a product of its inability to deal effectively with the old state. It can only be politically reintegrated after a complete political surrender on its part, which is unlikely. • Egypt is becoming increasingly ungovernable. The state cannot convert its reasserted dominance into legitimacy, and as intrastate competition and unruly protest politics engulf the political arena, the country faces a politi- cal vacuum with no clear resolution. Findings The old state, with its competing institutional power centers, persists. The new constitution has the potential to exacerbate the problem, preserving the privileges of old state institutions and providing them the capacity to act as power brokers within a fragmented system. Egypt needs a complete reinvention of its political sphere. Despite the development of a contentious public space since 2011, Egypt still lacks a capa- ble political class, without which it will be unable to confront entrenched insti- tutional obstacles to democracy. The coalition that supported the July 2013 coup that overthrew then pres- ident Mohamed Morsi is fragmenting. A split is developing between groups 1', '2 | Egypt’s Post-Mubarak Predicament that want to reproduce Mubarak’s authoritarianism and those that support a more democratic future for Egypt. No one group has monopolized the debate. The possibility of reconciliation between the regime and the Muslim Brotherhood remains elusive. So far, the Brotherhood has chosen a path of political intransigence. Given the regime’s crackdown and the Brothers’ political incentives against moderation, they face an increasingly limited set of options. Democratic forces must overcome leadership and capacity deficiencies. They need to move beyond hollow slogans and develop tactics that support their goals. The development of a successful democratic movement is crucial for Egypt’s future.', 'Introduction Confusion and incoherence in Egypt following the 2011 uprising against the regime of former president Hosni Mubarak have left analysts puzzled and unde- cided about the nature of the political evolution of the country. Many point to the problems of a putative democratic transition as the source of Egypt’s woes. However, more than simply struggling to achieve a democratic system, Egypt is still grappling with the continued reality of an outdated, authoritarian, and oligarchic old state. Egypt is in need of a complete reinvention of its poli- tics: wholly new state-citizen relations based on democratic Egypt is in need of a complete reinvention social, political, and economic contracts. Such a far-reach- ing transformation is necessary to address the country’s of its politics: wholly new state-citizen myriad socioeconomic and political problems. relations based on democratic social, The fall of the Mubarak regime was a hopeful moment political, and economic contracts. for many revolutionaries. The January 2011 uprising was spurred by a demand for changes to state authoritarianism and despotism in Egypt. The main enemies in this context were the old state’s military and civilian institutions and their associated networks and interest groups, as well as these forces’ political worldview, interests, and value system. But that system did not disappear with Mubarak’s ouster in February 2011. Rather, the strongman’s overthrow ushered in more of the same—an authori- tarian political process. This time around, the process was dominated first by the military and then by a new partner, the Muslim Brotherhood. After two and a half years of confusion and disturbance, the military removed the country’s first elected president, the Muslim Brotherhood–affili- ated Mohamed Morsi, from power on July 3, 2013. Both the Brotherhood-led regime and the military’s decision to overthrow it were described as “dem- ocratic” and “revolutionary” by their respective supporters, but despite this empty rhetoric, both were not. Problems continue to mount in Egypt, and the existing political forces have proven unable to deliver any real solutions. The country faces a societal and polit- ical vacuum, with no democratic, popularly based governing institutions to fill the void. The undemocratic, proto-fascist, and intransigent Islamist movement’s political behavior has exacerbated the void that emerged when Mubarak was overthrown. Moreover, the old state’s deep authoritarianism continues to plague Egyptian society and thwart efforts at real change, while infant democratic pro- test movements are incapable of offering a viable third way. 3', '4 | Egypt’s Post-Mubarak Predicament In many ways, Egypt is now back where it was nearly three years ago. The popular mobilization against Morsi, which reached its crescendo in the mass demonstrations of June 2013, signaled a reorientation. Following the long parentheses of Muslim Brotherhood rule, society is returning to the revolution- ary battle lines against the old state’s authoritarianism. Some optimists believe that after the old state finishes off the Brothers, it will establish a democracy. At the root of this hope, however, lies either naïveté or dishonesty. The current political process, framed by the military’s announcement of a political road map after Morsi’s overthrow, is no less authoritarian than that led by the military and the Muslim Brotherhood together after Mubarak’s ouster. Furthermore, the new political process does not position the interim government to better handle Egypt’s current crisis of democratic legitimacy, much less create a better political future for Egyptians. A political battle rages on between the old state and the Islamists, immobilizing all political actors in the country. A new, inclusive, democratic polity is not likely to emerge soon, but the old authoritarian system cannot be sustainably reproduced either. Though the old state is reasserting its dominance over the political system, it faces endemic crises of legitimacy and performance. As long as the institutional crises of the state, society, and economy persist, the old state will remain incapable of turn- ing its current dominance into a legitimate grip on power, and Egypt’s prob- lems will remain unsolvable. Accordingly, any future success on key issues, including economic development, state modernization, security, and political stability, will remain highly unlikely. All this means the system will continue to suffer from a lack of acceptable, inclusive rules of the game. In addition, the sizeable coalition that supported the July 3 coup is divided into subgroups of actors with different viewpoints about the new political sys- tem. These include the more conservative political forces who want to repro- duce the authoritarian, clientelist, and elitist politics of the Mubarak era as well as those who want to introduce substantial policy and governance reforms. Both options are problematic and lack widespread support for various reasons. Different state actors are competing with one another for influence, resources, and power. These elite divisions and this rapacious intrastate com- petition have led to considerable differences among political players about the new constitution\n",

Cordesman With the assistance of Max Molot Working Draft: Updated October 25, 2019 Please provide comments to acordesman@gmail.com Photo: AHMAD AL-RUBAYE/AFP/Getty Images', 'Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Yemen: The Long-Term Civil Challenges and Host Country Threats from “Failed State” Wars Anthony H. Cordesman This analysis explores several key aspects of the longer-term civil challenges that have curbed U.S. success in its “long wars” in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria — as well as its more limited involvements in Libya and Yemen. It focuses on the fact that all five states have deep structural problems that make them “failed states” in many similar areas of governance, major social changes, and development. It shows that these failures are so serious that they make the “host country” or national government a key cause of civil unrest and conflict and – in many ways – as much of a threat as the extremist and terrorist movements the U.S. is seeking to defeat. Looking Beyond Symptoms Like Extremism and Terrorism to Host Countries and Regimes as the Cause of Civil Violence The analysis warns that these structural problems are likely to shape many new civil conflicts and outbreaks of extremism, terrorism, and civil conflict in the MENA region, South Asia, and Central Asia. It also warns that they will be powerful, enduring destabilizing forces regardless of how successful the U.S., its partners, and the host country are in terms of defeating terrorist movements and insurgencies. Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya and Yemen — and many of their neighbors — not only have extremely poor governance, and high levels of corruption, they are under intense pressure from increases in population, urbanization, and social change that go far beyond their current problems with any given groups of extremists. These problems are so serious that they are likely to lead to further extremism, and civil conflict for at least the next decade. They also are so serious that no attempt at dealing with major threats from extremism, terrorism, or insurgency can be successful that only focuses on the security and military dimensions of such threats. The same is true of any efforts that focus on peace negotiations and short-term recovery aid. “Nation-building” does impose massive challenges of its own, but ignoring the forces that create “failed states” will both make any truly successful effort at conflict resolution impossible, but almost ensure the rise or resurgence of terrorism and civil conflict. This analysis does not attempt to simplify the range of factors involved or to find a single set of main causes of extremism, terrorism, and insurgency. It does not attempt to offer simply or optimistic answers to problems that need far more in-depth analysis, and where it may be impossible to find truly workable solutions until a given state is finally driven to the point where it is ready to help itself. In the real world, the only practical choice may be to contain the threats in given country to its own territory – a form of strategic triage that must give priority to countries that are actually willing to address their civil challenges and have the unity to act. The goal of this analysis is to demonstrate the full level of complexity involved, and to suggest that that any successful effort must look beyond defeating current enemies, look beyond current military and security trends, and look beyond the more immediate and topical civil causes of extremism like leadership, politics, and extremist ideologies.', 'The Key Long-Term Forces that Create “Failed States” This report focuses on exploring the deep structural reasons these five nations have become “failed states,” and comparing the civil trends involved. Its Table of Contents is shown below, and it shows that the study focuses on the civil side of civil-military relations. It attempts to find quantitative metrics that illustrate the importance of each key factor, and it examines key longer- term trends in the following forces that will make Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Yemen enduring problems: • The enduring civil costs of terrorism, insurgency and civil war, and their post conflict impact. • The impact of key problems in governance that are often largely independent of a particular leader and the country’s political system – whether democratic or authoritarian. • The permeating impact of corruption, which along with security and secure employment/income poll as the three key sources of resentment, anger, and loss of confidence in the regime. • The radical ongoing shifts growing out of demographics, population pressure, a major youth bulge, and shifts in the economy and social structure from agriculture and to service, government jobs, industry, and urbanization. Military Operations and Tactical Victories Cannot “Win” America’s Current Wars The analysis indicates that these civil forces are so important that the ability to help a given country deal with these longer-term challenges in civil-military affairs will be as important in achieving any kind of lasting victory and ongoing stability as the goal of military success and dealing with shorter term civil issues like politics and leadership. It also shows why U.S. military efforts in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan, Libya, and Yemen that focus too narrowly on security, counterterrorism, and counterinsurgency will not lead to real victories in terms of conflict resolution or to lasting favorable outcomes and national stability. The United States cannot win in any of these countries by fighting half a war – focusing on the direct enemy rather than the flaws in the host county it is trying to aid, and by prioritizing the security sector at the expense of the civil one. More broadly, the forces that helped turn Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Yemen into “failed states” that do not meet the basic needs of their peoples are common to far too many other states in the developing world. While this study does not examine such cases, it is also clear that similar forces have helped shape violence and extremism in a wide range of African states, in Pakistan and several Central Asian states, in countries as diverse as Nepal and Cambodia, and in nations like Columbia and most Central American states. The “failed state” or “failing state” problem is not the function of a given culture or religion. It is a function of broader forces that affect all too many countries throughout the developing world. If the U.S. is to limit the growth of extremism and terrorism within new civil wars and insurgencies, and promote stability in key states, it must look at Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Yemen as case studies in the causes of instability and such threats to American interests and the American Homeland. It must work with other states to address such civil challenges, both to limit the rise of new threats and limit its involvement in future wars.', 'Table of Contents LOOKING BEYOND SYMPTOMS LIKE EXTREMISM AND TERRORISM TO HOST COUNTRIES AND REGIMES AS THE CAUSE OF CIVIL VIOLENCE .................................................................................................................................................................................. 2 THE KEY LONG-TERM FORCES THAT CREATE “FAILED STATES” ................................................................................................ 3 Military Operations and Tactical Victories Cannot “Win” America’s Current Wars ............................................. 3 THE ENDURING CIVIL COSTS OF TERRORISM AND WAR ......................................................................................... 6 TRACING THE PATTERNS IN VIOLENCE ................................................................................................................................ 7 Figure One: Arab Role in Global Terrorism and Violence ..................................................................................... 8 Figure Two: The Broader Patterns of Violence within the Arab World Through 2017 ......................................... 9 THE COSTS IN KILLED AND WOUNDED .............................................................................................................................. 10 THE COSTS TO THE LIVING AND SURVIVORS ....................................................................................................................... 11 Figure Three: Estimated Impact of Continued Conflicts on Total Population of Arab Countries: 1990-2030 .... 13 Figure Four: The Impact of the “Arab Winter” on Increases in Refugees and Forced Displacements: 2010-2017 ........................................................................................................................................................................... 14 Figure Five: World Bank Estimate of Internally Displaced Persons, Total Displaced by Conflict and Violence: 2009-2018 .......................................................................................................................................................... 15 Figure Six: Syria as a Case Study: UN Estimate of Human Cost of War as of December 2018 ........................... 16 Figure Seven: Impact of Violence and Instability on Percent of Working Poor: 2000-2017 ............................... 17 THE UNKNOWN HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC COSTS OF WAR AND TRANSITION TO NEW PATHS OF DEVELOPMENT ........ 18 Figure Eight: Comparative Human Development Estimates in Countries with Failed State Wars ..................... 19 Figure Nine: Regression in Human Development Indicators Since the “Arab Winter” Began in 2011 ............... 20 Figure Ten: The Economic Cost of Extremism Before the Most Serious Impacts of the Fighting Iraq and Syria 21 LOOKING AT PERCEPTIONS OF CAUSES ....................................\n",

More than six million people www.giga-hamburg.de/giga-focus have been internally displaced, while well over five million have fled the country – with the majority residing in Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey. Like the spaces of civilian political agency in different parts of the world, ones of humanitarian protection also seem to be shrinking in some of the main refugee-hosting states in the Middle East too. • Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey have taken in millions of Syrian refugees since the beginning of the Syrian war. All three countries followed an open-door policy in the first phase of the Syrian conflict, assuming that the uprising would be as short-lived as its precedents in Tunisia and Egypt. • All three states have implemented a temporary protection regime, on the one hand providing fast and relatively non-bureaucratic refuge for Syrians fleeing while on the other excluding them from the special protection that comes with official refugee status. • All three states have experienced the shocking disinterest of the international community in the Syrian crisis, which became most apparent in the enduring and severe underfunding of aid efforts in the region. • All three states have since almost completely reversed their initial policies, with border closings, migrant criminalisations, and refoulement becoming regular practices. The movement out of the region and towards supposedly “safer” areas like the European Union has engendered a vicious circle of migrant deter- rence and pressure on transit states, in which the refugees themselves are mere pawns. Policy Implications The continually progressing walling-off policies of the Global North increase the likelihood of Syrians staying in Jordan, Lebanon, or Turkey. Many would like to return home to rebuild their lives. It is, however, unclear how they will fare if Syria – where the war is still ongoing – is reconstructed in cooperation with the old regime and its cronies. Both internal and external actors need to recognise this in their efforts to reconstruct the state.', 'From Open Door to Deterrence Since the beginning of the Syrian civil war, Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey have ad- mitted hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees and provided them with tempo- rary protection. often, the Islamic umma was invoked to justify this “open-door policy”; what is more, the swift success of similar uprisings in Egypt, Tunisia, and Yemen can doubtlessly be considered a decisive factor for the three governments’ willingness to initially tolerate the inflow of Syrians. However the spaces of humani- tarian protection provided by each of the three states began to shrink from 2014 onwards, when it became clear that the Syrian war was not going to be over any time soon, that the refugees were more likely to stay than to return, and that the inter- national community was unwilling to share the burden – as was illustrated by both the severe underfunding of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and a strong focus on immigration deterrence. Internal dynamics – the escalation of the Kurdish issue and an attempted coup in Turkey, progressing political fragmentation in Lebanon, economic troubles in Jordan – also contributed to a decrease in support for hospitality towards Syrians. With spaces of protection rapidly shrinking in Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey, more and more refugees would embark on the precarious journey towards Europe – leading to what has been dubbed the “European refugee crisis,” meaning a political crisis of asylum and immigration governance in the European Union. After a short humanitarian phase in (parts of) Europe in 2015, the Union has since returned to predominantly and increasingly hostile (im)migration and asylum policies – fo- cusing mainly on the deterrence of immigrants and progressively externalising EU border protection to non-EU countries like Libya and Turkey. This development started a vicious circle with regard to migration and asylum policies in the EU and its southern and south-eastern neighbourhood: the more restrictive EU immigra- tion policies became, the more pressure was being felt in sending and transit states to keep migrants “in the region” or “close to home” – and, meanwhile, the less pro- tection has been available for refugees themselves. Shrinking Spaces of Protection in Jordan After the Syrian revolution quickly deteriorated into a violent civil war in 2011, a steady flow of Syrian refugees started to arrive in Jordan through the kingdom’s northern border from April of that year onwards. by June 2013, Zaatari – Jordan’s first and largest refugee camp for Syrian refugees – was hosting 120,000 people, making it one of Jordan’s largest urban centres. by the end of August 2013, more than 2,000 Syrian refugees were arriving per day in Zaatari alone. However, over 80 per cent of Syrians in Jordan have settled outside of the country’s refugee camps. Today, Jordan hosts some 670,000 Syrian refugees according to the UNHCR. [1] The 1 https://data2.unhcr.org/en/ monarchy under King Abdullah II, however, has stated that the number of Syrians living in situations/syria/location/36. Jordan is as high as 1.4 million, as it claims that approximately 750,000 Syrians had already been living in Jordan before 2011. While it is unclear how this figure was calculated and likely that it is too high, “the proportion of the Jordanian population that is comprised of Syrians is currently estimated to be between one-tenth and one-sixth” (Bank 2016: 3). GIGA FoCUS | MIDDLE EAST | No. 6 | DECEMbEr 2018 2', 'Refugees from the Syrian civil war are not the only group of refugees living in Jordan: more than half of the Jordanian population of around 10 million people are considered to have Palestinian roots.

This explains, at least in part, why estimates of Syrian refugees in Jordan vary widely depending on who is speaking about them and what the over- arching agenda is. There was historically no visa requirement for Syrians travelling to Jordan (and vice versa), so that crossing the border had for decades been a common practice among those living in the borderlands and those having business in either state – while strong family and clan ties connected the two peoples as well. At the begin- ning of the crisis, indeed, many Syrian citizens coming to Jordan stayed with host families, indicative of these strong pre-established ties; it was only later that Syr- ians began to rent their own spaces and/or were channelled to transit facilities and refugee camps. The first camp for Syrian refugees in Jordan, Zaatari, only opened in July 2012 – that is, over a year into the civil war. overall, Jordan has established four official refugee camps for Syrians: Zaatari, Azraq, and the much smaller King Abdullah Park and Cyber City. Up until late 2014, residents could exit these camps through a sponsored bailout procedure; this policy has since been substituted by increasingly restrictive ones (Achilli 2015) which entail that most camp inhabitants have little opportunity to leave them legally, except by returning to Syria (Turner 2015). Jordan is not a signatory to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refu- gees, and has no specific asylum laws. A memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the Government of Jordan and the UNHCR from 1998 is the basis for the UNHCR’s work in the kingdom. It states that asylum seekers have the right to re- main in Jordan for six months after recognition as such; during this time span, the UNHCR has to find a durable solution for them.

            "['Introduction The speed with which the COVID-19 pandemic brought the global economy and so-called fortress nations to their knees, buckled healthcare systems, and crushed carefully conceived response plans should prompt deep societal reflection. When the pandemic finally clears and nations tally the human and economic toll of this crisis, one certainty will be a long list of lost lives and livelihoods. The central task now is to ensure that the sacrifices of once hidden heroes in the medical, scientific and educational communities and the trillions in national treasure spent in the heat of battle on recovery efforts will not be squandered. To realize that goal, any post-pandemic response and recovery plan must produce a better world. Great crises often lay the groundwork for great reforms. Just as the incalculable toll of World War II gave birth to new international institutions with the twin charges of keeping the peace and ensuring that a rules-based economic system spread prosperity around the world, this crisis will give rise to new solutions and institutions. The COVID-19 pandemic will infect and affect millions of people, claim hundreds of thousands of lives, and cost trillions of dollars. This is a collective sacrifice that cannot be in vain. Along these lines, a new study has shown that lockdown efforts, while piecemeal across the country, may have averted 60 million cases. Global crises, like the COVID-19 pandemic that began in Wuhan, China and in a matter of five months affected more than 188 countries, proving that viruses, like vector-borne diseases and vile ideologies that span the globe, do not respect national borders. Except this time around, rather than coalitions of countries fighting together, like the post-war rules-based system would dictate, including via the guidance of multilateral health bodies like the World Health Organization (WHO), countries have taken the fight to the invisible threat all alone. Politicizing the response to the pandemic, even in its earliest days, greatly hindered the world’s ability to mount a credible testing, containment, mitigation, and recovery strategy. Instead of following the guidance of public health officials and epidemiological experts, many countries adopted a zero-sum approach, introducing “beggar-thy-neighbor” healthcare responses while resurrecting national border controls not seen in a hundred years. Indeed, European countries all but shredded the Schengen agreement that was first introduced in 1985 to enable the free flow of people and commerce across 26 European nations. In the United States, as the pandemic’s epicenter moved from a nursing home in Kirkland, Washington, where it was first spotted, to New York, to elsewhere across the country, neighboring states erected de facto barriers of their own. In Rhode Island, for example, police and National Guard units were deployed at the border with New York to check travelers and enforce mandatory 14-day quarantines. The home of the free and brave became the home of the newamerica.org/digital-impact-governance-initiative/reports/great-correction/ 6', 'quarantined and cowed as strict social distancing rules defined a surreal new normal. Tellingly, for the first time in history, all 50 U.S. states and territories were under disaster declarations. As much as the coronavirus pandemic has brought the world to its knees, it has also revealed a number of areas where the fate of the planet, countries, and perhaps humanity is intertwined. Amid a rising tide of economic nationalism and populist sentiments that predated the outbreak, the world faced a threat that does not respect traditional forms of perceived strength any more than it recognizes wealth, religion, creed, or political allegiance. It has fractured societies and alliances, but the pandemic could yet emerge as a unifying force to the extent it reminds us of our common frailty, interdependence, and utter lack of preparedness for complex emerging threats. With the impact of climate change looming on the horizon, the pandemic might be humanity’s last best hope to develop a more coordinated global approach to other major societal risks. Some claim—wrongly—that the pandemic’s disruptive consequences were unpredictable. Like other great crises, the coronavirus itself did not break the global economy, national healthcare systems, or response capabilities. Rather, it revealed areas that were already broken. The pandemic also revealed that much of the new fatalism regarding population scale technology platforms may have missed the mark. Notwithstanding the real and troubling flaws that exist in many technology platforms, technology, when universally deployed, can not only level the playing field, it can help ensure business, operational, educational, and governmental continuity in the face of major disruptions. The video conferencing services that kept millions of students in virtual classrooms also kept a few cylinders of the global economy turning. The absence of universal hardware, software, and internet connectivity across a range of essential systems, from education, to banking, healthcare, elections, and payments, proved to be a real hindrance in pandemic response and recovery efforts. Some countries have clearly used the pandemic as an excuse to exploit technology and violate human rights. However, overall, technology has proven to be a force for good through this crisis. From crowdsourcing data feeds that aggregated the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases around the world, often with detailed geographical accuracy at county or city levels, to 3D-printed essential medical equipment for frontline healthcare providers, the ability to pivot supply chains from lean, global, and just-in-time (which proved to be more tightly strung than a Stradivarius violin), to hyper-local sourcing, has been key in this battle. Indeed, the absence of anything close to an adequate strategic global stockpile of ventilators, personal protective equipment (PPE) and N95 masks (all items that were subject to national and private sector hoarding, price gouging, and health newamerica.org/digital-impact-governance-initiative/reports/great-correction/ 7', 'security arbitrage), turned an already calamitous event into a template for human, governance, and market failure. Many countries, including the United States, resorted to wartime powers to shift their industrial base away from routine production toward manufacturing hand sanitizer, protective equipment, and other medical gear that was in short supply. For the vulnerable sectors of the world’s population that did not succumb to the virus while undergoing medical care, sadly far too many perished for what will be proven to be a preventable loss due to the shortage of basic medical supplies and hospital beds per capita. Others, such as the financially vulnerable and minority communities, have proven to have higher mortality rates for obvious reasons. Their need to subsist through exposed jobs, along with underlying health and lifestyle issues, exposed a two-tier medical system. Having already pledged trillions of dollars in direct aid to U.S. citizens through tax deferments, loans, and corporate bailouts of vulnerable sectors—ostensibly the largest non-war economic recovery package in world history—we must now pledge to use this societal down payment to build more resilient institutions and a more resilient country. To that end, this white paper is designed to serve as a blueprint for renovating areas of our public infrastructure that have not fared well amid the pandemic. Given the depth of the rot in so many of our institutions and systems, the crisis presents an opportunity to not only rebuild, but to emerge better off, with a heightened ability to address the challenges on our long national horizon. newamerica.org/digital-impact-governance-initiative/reports/great-correction/ 8', 'Election Integrity Even before the pandemic raised serious questions about election integrity and continuity in an environment of social distancing, the U.S. electoral process labored under the long shadow of the 2016 presidential election. Adding to the ongoing concerns about cyber vulnerabilities, voter suppression, and disinformation risks, the pandemic underscored how the lack of broad-based electoral options is a vulnerability. Some state and local elections were postponed in order to help flatten the curve of the outbreak. Others, like Nebraska, Illinois, and Wisconsin, carried on with voting, much to the chagrin of public health officials and national figures. Even before the crisis, the fact that the United States does not enjoy anything close to an omnichannel voting experience that enfranchises citizens and enables votes to be cast and counted using technology, mail-in ballots, and other options was a pre-pandemic vulnerability. The pandemic, however, as with other areas in the U.S. economy, laid bare the difficulty and absurdity of long lines of people waiting to fulfill their civic duty. Here too, the voting process weighs most heavily on the poor and vulnerable, who often have to endure a loss of productive time at work, may not be able to reach polling stations or are single parents, among other challenges. A recent study analyzed smartphone data to estimate that voters in African American neighborhoods waited 29 percent longer to vote. Secure mail-in ballots or e- voting options to facilitate as wide and participatory a process as possible is not a partisan matter, but a patriotic one. This is also true of overseas voters, the enlisted and the veterans, rural communities, among many others. Sadly, calls for strengthening election integrity and security have largely gone unheeded since 2016 as the fiercely partisan fights rage on in Washington, D.C. With policymakers mostly focused on airing grievances from past elections, rather than protecting present and future ones, the pandemic proved to be as indiscriminate about political stripes\n",

Policy Implications This pandemic could be an opportunity to realise access to vaccines and medi- cines for all. The high-level public debate about medicines as a global public good is unprecedented, and there are promising examples of collective action. It remains to be seen whether national governments and pharmaceutical companies can be held accountable by the defenders of a global public good approach re- garding their publicly voiced commitment to “access for all.”', 'Pathway and Impact of the Pandemic in the Global South Recognising the pandemic nature of COVID-19 has led to great concerns about the problems of poor countries in dealing with the disease. Potentially catastrophic im- pacts are feared in particular in low- and a number of middle-income countries (lICs and MICs), with large groups of marginalised people in poor rural areas and urban slums. Other recent GIGA Foci have already highlighted the specific prob- lems faced in Africa, latin America, and the Middle East as a result of the pandemic (see “Related GIGA Publications”). It appears that food markets have been particu- lar hubs of infection helping spread the virus in latin American countries (Collyns et al. 2020). The countries of the Arabian Peninsula are now among those with the highest rates of infections per one million inhabitants. However, this might be skewed because of their comparatively high rate of testing. At the same time they exhibit a comparatively low death rate due to their highly developed health systems. While sub-Saharan Africa was less severely hit until early April compared to other parts of the world, the pandemic has since started to gain pace there. There is also an imminent risk that COVID-19 will lead to more violent conflict on the continent, as basedau and Deitch (2020) outline. by now, another hotspot of infection has developed in South Asia. India has 586,956 confirmed infections and 17,417 deaths (as of 1 July), with 8,826,585 tests conducted (meaning only about 0.64 per cent of the population have been tested so far). A rigidly imposed lockdown, wearing of face masks in major Indian cities and many states being compulsory, and internal travel restrictions have resulted in reported hardships linked to these measures. The lockdown led to an exodus of mi- grant workers desperately trying to reach their home villages. Kerala, on the other hand, is demonstrating that basic health system infrastructure and investments in human capital can make all the difference in controlling a pandemic even despite scarce resources: the state has a strong, highly decentralised public health system, clear risk communication, and effective community participation, all based on the enduring state welfare regime established by the Communist Party of India. High rates of informal employment, weak health systems, and very limited test- ing capacities are only some of the reasons why this pandemic represents a critical challenge for many lICs and lMICs. For example, while lombardy – a hard-hit region in Italy – had about 700 Intensive Care Unit beds for a population of 10.4 million people, Mali and burkina Faso have less than 20 ventilators for respective popula- tions almost twice as large (Haas and Teachout 2020). According to an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) study (2020a), about 86 per cent of total employment in Africa is informal and 82 per cent of the population are without social protection. Another critical aspect concerns food supplies; though a report of the Food and Agricultural Organization states that recent harvests have been good and the outlook for staple crops is promising, it warns of “indirect effects such as disruption of livelihoods, food supply chains and access to food, basic ser- vices as well as humanitarian assistance” (2020: 6) – also affecting food supplies for the urban poor. The disruption of international trade affects the income of African exporters as well as the supply of essential imports. The World Health Organization (WHO) regularly updates its guidance for coun- tries on how to maintain essential health services in the face of the pandemic. De- spite very different sociocultural and economic preconditions between the G lobal GIGA FOCuS | GlObAl | NO. 4 | July 2020 2', 'South and the Global North, the measures implemented in most high income coun- tries (HICs) have been recommended as general coping mechanisms. Collateral Damage of Focusing All Efforts on COVID-19 However, more and more politicians from lICs have articulated that they are not in a position to afford a strict lockdown. For one, an economic lockdown can be a more imminent threat to lives and livelihoods by depriving millions of income and food. As protesting traders in Ghana put it: “They knew the lockdown was needed to curb the spread of the virus but they were not in a position to survive it” (Akinwotu and Asiedu 2020). Furthermore, a complete lockdown might not be warranted in many lICs for other reasons besides. Cash and Patel point out that “for the first time in the post- war history of epidemics, there is a reversal of which countries are most heavily affected by a disease pandemic” (2020: 1687). Many countries of the Global South exhibit a lower risk of COVID-19-related mortality since their populations are much younger. Since the beginning of the pandemic people in lICs and MICs have con- tinued to die in the millions from numerous diseases that have been prevalent for much longer. For example, deaths among children under five from pneumonia in lICs and MICs were estimated at almost 900,000 for 2015 (McAllister et al. 2019). This number represents a reduction of 47 per cent during the Millennium Devel- opment Goal period since the year 2000, which is consistent with a decreasing prevalence of risk factors and increasing socio-economic development, prevention, and improved access to quality healthcare. The strong focus on fighting COVID-19 threatens to turn back the clock on years of progress and severely increase morbid- ity and mortality for many diseases. Vaccination campaigns, for example, have been suspended in many countries, and the cessation of public transport has specifically prevented poor people as well as healthcare workers from reaching medical facili- ties. For all these reasons, Cash and Patel (2020) emphasise that context is essential in controlling a pandemic and question the appropriateness of HIC strategies for peers with fewer resources. Wealthier countries are now allegedly coming to the rescue of those less well- endowed – not least to mitigate effects resulting from their “one-size-fits-all” lock- down advice. At first sight, the international support announced by various in- stitutions appears overwhelming. The G20 Action Plan (“Supporting the Global Economy Through the COVID-19 Pandemic”) presented on 15 April is the most comprehensive document of cooperation in the global fight against the p andemic. G20 members agreed on a suspension of debt service payments for the poorest countries during 2020. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has developed a crisis response package offering a USD 1 trillion lending capacity and the World Bank and Regional Development Banks are offering emergency response packages of more than USD 200 billion. For African countries already suffering from increas- ing debt services in previous years this only means, however, a short-term easing of their foreign debt. In fact, by using the offered credits their foreign debt situation could become even more severe in the medium term.

            "['Policy Insights 98 November 2020 US and Chinese COVID-19 Health Outreach to Africa and Latin America: A Comparison PAULO ESTEVES & COBUS VAN STADEN African perspectives Global insights', 'Executive summary The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has arguably been worsened by the lack of a coordinated global response, driven in part by the tensions between the US and China. On a wider scale, the pandemic has also driven a nationalist turn that undercuts regional and multilateral approaches. This policy insight tracks these trends, and shows how the pandemic has strengthened pre-existing trends away from globalisation. However, even in this divided field, international outreach has played an important role in mitigating the impact of the pandemic. A comparison is drawn between the outreach by China and by the US to Africa and Latin America. While the US has depended largely on its earlier initiatives, China has committed significant new resources to the COVID-19 fight. Both sides have tried to use these measures to gain diplomatic ground, with especially China drawing on a wide range of state and non-state actors. Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has been an unprecedented challenge to healthcare systems globally. Medical institutions in both the developed and developing worlds have come under massive strain owing to the large number of confirmed cases and the increased pressure for testing. The pandemic has also stretched the organisational capacity of national and transnational health authorities. However, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic reaches far wider than healthcare. It has triggered the largest economic crisis since the Great Depression, and kicked off a related debt crisis in large parts of the Global South. This has implications for the entirety of global trade, investment and geopolitics. While the crisis represents a challenge to many national, regional and global healthcare systems, it also shows how these challenges overlap with the geopolitical and diplomatic priorities of great powers While, at its heart, the crisis represents a challenge to many national, regional and global healthcare systems, it also shows how these challenges overlap with the geopolitical and diplomatic priorities of great powers. To illustrate this point, this policy insight investigates two regions in the Global South: Africa and Latin America. They are comparable as case studies of cross-border coordination in the face of the global pandemic. But they have also proven comparable in terms of how they have been targeted by competing health diplomacy initiatives by wealthy countries, notably the US and China. After looking at the impact of the pandemic on global systems – particularly global supply chains, political 2 Policy Insights 98 | US AND CHINESE COVID-19 HEALTH OUTREACH TO AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA: A COMPARISON', 'cooperation and the balance between nationalism and regional cooperation – this policy insight compares the Chinese and US health outreach to Africa and Latin America, showing that diplomatic priorities shape responses in both regions. It concludes with suggestions on improving the efficacy of the global health outreach to the Global South. Systemic impacts While the COVID-19 epidemic is having unprecedented impacts on global healthcare systems, its full impact is much bigger. These wider systemic impacts are not only complicating healthcare provision but also reshaping global systems. Global supply chains The impact of the pandemic and the related economic crises on global supply chains must be seen against the background of the global trade trends that predate the crisis. In many ways the pandemic has hastened and complicated these trends, while uncovering previously unexamined weaknesses in the global trade system. Even before the pandemic struck, the global trade system had been undergoing significant changes, owing to the rising trade tensions between the US and China. The Trump administration’s imposition of tariffs on selected categories of Chinese goods set off a tit- for-tat tariff war between the two superpowers. The slowly escalating trade crisis put both financial and political pressure on the numerous US firms that manufacture and assemble in China to ‘reshore’ these activities to the US. In reality, while several of them started to divest from China, the majority ended up shifting facilities to other states such as Vietnam rather than the US.1 A second long-term factor was the weakening of the global institutional trade architecture through the withdrawal of support to the World Trade Organization (WTO). The activities of the WTO essentially ground to a halt in late 2019, owing to the US’ refusal to approve the appointment of appellate judges. While these factors did not fully impact world trade, they did increase uncertainty, and strengthened perceptions of a global trading system under political stress.2 The pandemic has rapidly worsened this situation, and in the process revealed significant weaknesses in the global trade system. In the first place, the crisis started in China, and the resulting lockdown interrupted supply chains around the world. As Chinese factories closed, 1 See, for example, Michelle Jamrisko, “Vietnam Is a Trade War Winner. Now It Has to Figure Out How to Stay Ahead”, Bloomberg, October 29, 2019, https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-new-economy-drivers-and-disrupters/vietnam.html. 2 “WTO Judge Blockage Could Prove ‘the Beginning of the End’”, Deutsche Welle, December 10, 2019, https://www.dw.com/en/wto- judge-blockage-could-prove-the-beginning-of-the-end/a-51613082#:~:text=The%20US%20has%20been%20blocking,dispute%20 cases%20at%20midnight%20Tuesday. 3 Policy Insights 98 | US AND CHINESE COVID-19 HEALTH OUTREACH TO AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA: A COMPARISON', 'the manufacturing and assembly of millions of products ceased. This shutdown threatened the global supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves and masks, as well as crucial medical equipment such as ventilators. It also had a serious impact on global stocks of pharmaceuticals, owing to the size and reach of China’s massive industry, which supplies not only medication but also the chemical components used in other countries’ pharmaceutical industries.3 The crisis in Chinese manufacturing was exacerbated as the rest of the world shut down in response to the pandemic. Flights and ships between China and the rest of the world were cancelled, leading to products piling up at harbours while shops around the world emptied. Some of these impacts have been mitigated by China’s largely successful containment of the outbreak and its relatively rapid return to manufacturing. However, sectors with complicated supply chains have suffered multiple disruptions in both sourcing raw materials, manufacturing and assembly, and in getting the finished products to consumers. The impact of the first quarter’s crisis on global trade was unprecedented. In October 2020 the WTO estimated a 9.2% fall in global trade merchandise volume; a shrinkage it projected would last into 2021.4 The crisis has made the centrality of Chinese manufacturing to the global economy clear in most trade sectors. This, together with the wider political tensions between China and the US, has elicited calls from around the world to shorten supply chains and simplify global production processes The crisis has made the centrality of Chinese manufacturing to the global economy clear in most trade sectors. This, together with the wider political tensions between China and the US, has elicited calls from around the world to shorten supply chains and simplify global production processes. The shortage of PPE needed to protect healthcare workers and the public at large, as well as crucial medical equipment such as ventilators, provides a potent illustration of the danger of over-long supply chains. As the crisis struck, supplies of these crucial products quickly ran out, causing a global scramble in which the poorer countries of the Global South were shoved aside by their rich counterparts. The same problem erupted around pharmaceuticals. For example, despite the fact that the Trump administration’s 3 Deloitte, “The Impact of COVID-19 on China’s Pharmaceuticals Industry”, February 2020, https://www2.deloitte.com/za/en/pages/ life-sciences-and-healthcare/articles/gx-pharma-industry-survey-results-2019-ncov.html. 4 World Trade Organization, “Trade Shows Signs of Rebound from COVID-19, Recovery Still Uncertain”, Press Release 862, October 6, 2020, https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/pres20_e/pr862_e.htm. 4 Policy Insights 98 | US AND CHINESE COVID-19 HEALTH OUTREACH TO AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA: A COMPARISON', 'claims of hydroxychloroquine’s efficacy in treating COVID-19 were soon disproven, supplies of this drug ran out, creating a crisis for the lupus patients who depend on it.5 These supply chain problems will no doubt cast a long shadow over coming efforts to distribute a COVID-19 vaccine. The difficulties in developing and testing a successful vaccine will be matched by the complex logistics involved in keeping it cold and transporting it across the world. The calls for onshoring and shortening supply chains are also affecting thinking around these challenges. In the African case, this is leading to Chinese manufacturers’ setting up manufacturing and packing facilities on the continent.6 The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is also being felt in political systems globally. One of the immediate results was the closing of national borders, and the resultant weakening of many forms of global cooperation. The crisis has returned power to the nation state as a fundamental organising unit of global politics, with national governments becoming the prime decision makers about mitigation measures over regional and continental entities. The initial instinct towards nation states’ acting alone was understandable, but the closing of borders resulted in widespread disr\n",

            "['FOREWORD ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT More than six months since the world first learned of what we now call COVID-19, the time is right to take stock of where we are in the outbreak and how the world has responded. WHO published the first COVID-19 Strategic Response and The pandemic has already taken a terrible toll. By the end of June 2020, WHO had received Preparedness Plan (SPRP) on 3 February, 2020.

We are facing a June 2020 under the three objectives outlined in the SPRP: moment of great danger.

But in most of the world the virus is not under control – it on the resource requirements for the next phase of WHO’s is thriving on delay, denial, and division. response as part of an unprecedented whole-of-UN approach The world has shown that we are stronger when we act together with a common purpose. to the pandemic. Over 5000 patients in more than 20 countries have joined WHO’s Solidarity Trial, which will continue to answer questions about which treatments are most effective. More than 600 donor contributions have helped fund more than 108 COVID-19 national plans through the WHO Partners Platform. Through the end of June, the joint expertise and purchasing power of agencies brought together by the COVID-19 Supply Chain System had obtained 140 million items of personal protective equipment, 4.5 million laboratory test kits, and 5 million sample collection kits available for delivery throughout July and August 2020. The COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund for WHO raised more than US$224 million to support the response. The Global Research Forum brought together manufacturers, regulators, academics, national governments, civil society and international organizations to agree on a global roadmap to accelerate priority research and development. The Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator has been launched to ensure priority research is funded, and that new therapeutics, diagnostics and vaccines are available on the basis of need. By working with expert networks and collaborating centres around the world, in a matter of months WHO has published 130 guidance documents on various aspects of preparedness and response in different contexts, constantly updated as our knowledge of the virus and how best to beat it evolves. Through online and in-person training, technical missions and remote support, WHO regional offices have helped countries to translate guidance and strategies into national plans; more than 80% of countries now have such a plan, while WHO’s global and regional platforms, country offices, and collaborative initiatives such as the Global Outbreak Alert and Response network have helped to implement these plans on the ground. We have achieved a lot together, but our greatest challenges still lie ahead. As the pandemic continues to accelerate, the threat of COVID-19 is compounded by the increased risk of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases caused by delays and suspensions to immunization programmes and the interruption of core health services. Of the 63 countries prioritized for operational assistance by WHO, more than two-thirds have suspended or postponed vaccination programmes due to COVID-19, while less than a quarter have identified and planned for the continuity of core health services. Controlling COVID-19 is now the key to preventing the reversal of hard-won health and development gains in low-income countries that have taken decades to achieve. For the benefit of all, we must stand together against COVID-19. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus Credit: WHO WHO Director-General On 23 April 2020, the WHO country office in Ukraine supplied more than 65 000 items of PPE to the Department of Health of Kyiv City Council. The PPE, including surgical masks, gloves, goggles, and gowns, was delivered to frontline health care workers in more than 30 hospitals in Kyiv. 1 COVID-19: February–June progress report COVID-19: February–June progress report 2', 'RESPONSE IN ACTION The scale of the COVID-19 crisis has required a significant shift in the international system to support countries to plan, finance and implement their response, and WHO has led the international community in supporting these efforts across the world.

Parading themselves as “alternativès,” neofascists like Patrick Buchanan and David Duke have been capitalizing on people’s growing dissatisfaction with Democrats as well as Republicans. People are looking for an alterna- tive, but not everyone is turning to the right. We recently endorsed the campaign of Yolanda Alaniz, the first Chicana socialist candidate to run for Seattle City Council. Alaniz got 27,938 votes—17.5 percent—in the Nov. 5 general election! Alaniz, who ran as a Freedom Socialist Party candidate, called for taxing big business, not poor and working people; funding the cities by dismantling the war machine; estab- lishing citizens’ review boards to curb police abuse; nationalizing health care, utilities and major industries; and implementing other radical demands in the interest of the oppressed. Given her platform, it is no sur- prise that Alaniz’s endorsers included Seattle union and labor activists and leaders, local and national grass-roots organizers and internationally promi- nent spokespeople. Communities of color, like Seattle’s South End, responded to the city’s first truly mul- tilingual and multicultural campaign by becoming Alaniz’s largest voting constituency. It is also significant that many. homeless people supported her and worked on her campaign. We urge the Guardian in the future to cover campaigns of candidates .. who, like Alaniz, provide alternatives to the two-party system and address the root of the problem: capitalism. Alaniz’s campaign shows that revolu- tionary demands can get winning results!

JFK shot plot not rot I have greatly appreciated Jack Colhoun’s reporting, particularly his work on the October Surprise. With- out his efforts we would be unable to find any news about corruption in Washington. Major newspapers seem ' more occupied these days with dis- counting movie hyperbole than engaging in investigative journalism. The Washington Post is one exam- ple. Without exception, their editorial and opinion pages have been filled with pundits’ and politicians’ con- demnations of Oliver Stone’s conspir- atorial allegations in his movie “JEK.” With this considerable effort to dis- count Stone’s thesis, the jaundiced among us might conclude that some orchestrated effort was afoot to dampen growing dissatisfaction with the deception and duplicity that are rampant at all levels of gòvernment today. While I was never one to give much credence to conspiracy theo- ries, I must admit that, since Water- gate, I have had growing doubts about exactly who òúr government represents and who our media serve. While Stone’s movie may play fast and loose with the facts, “JFK” as a metaphor is extremely accurate. In light of the government’s complicity in the Iran-Contra, savings and loan ` and Bank of Credit & Commerce International scandals, and in light of ` Colhoun’s mounting evidence that the Reagan/Bush campaign conspired just prior to the 1980 election to delay the release of the hostages held in Iran, Stone’s 1960s fantasy is root- ed in the political realities of the 1990s. For many of Stone’s critics, it appears to be a much easier task to confront his fiction than to summon the courage and untangle the web of deceit and lies that currently perme- ates the highest offices of our govern- ment. i Bud A. McClure, St. Thomas, Pa. Support a four-day workweek I especially appreciate Jane Slaugh- ter’s suggestion (Jan. 29) that “a fight for a shorter workweek, to spread job erosion in the car industry. A four-day workweek would make room for more people to work and upgrade the lives of all working peo- ple. It would allow family members to spend more time together and give people time to study, reflect and get involved with unions and political groups. Without exhaustion from a five-day workweek, perhaps there would be less burnout and greater job performance as well. Judith Ackerman, New York, N.Y.

Whew! Little is lost of this publication’s radical- ity in the exhibits, but what does it mean when mainstream institutions give such rec- ognition to a magazine which fashions it- self as an enemy of the state? Yippie founder Abbie Hoffman once said, if they don\\'t jail you, and they don\\'t kill you, they\\'ll eventually honor you. More on this below. As it is, it is very unusual for a radical oppositional paper to outlive the period of contestation in which it was conceived. The Fifth Estate and a handful of other tabloid newspapers began publishing in 1965, a tumultuous period already set Part of the Fifth Estate 4-room exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit in its Mike Kelley Mobile Homestead facility. in motion by the valiant struggle of the civil rights and black power movements. The Fifth Estate was quickly joined by hundreds of other regularly appearing papers to the extent that by 1970, the Underground Press Syndicate could claim 500 publications with a total weekly circulation of four million readers. It’s impossible to count the irregularly appearing ones including at least 100 pub- lished inside the U.S. military by anti-Viet- nam war Gls, plus ones printed by rebellious high schoolers, labor caucuses, and community groups. Although these papers, like the movements they reported on, brought forth individual instances of insightful and talented writers and artists, they virtually created and wrote themselves. So intense was the re- sistance to a stultified society and culture defined by white privilege and empire, so self-satisfied were the defenders of the post-World War II triumphalism of an American Cen- The Layabouts on stage for the Fifth Estate\\'s 50 anniversary celebration, September 19.

In similar periods of revolt, particularly one lasting another half-century from 1890 to 1940, hundreds of publications, perhaps thousands came into being advocating labor rights, reform, anarchism, socialism, and communism. It’s difficult to imagine now that the anarcho-syndicalist Industrial Work- ers of the World (IWW) among its many papers, printed a', 'FIFTH ESTATE One of seven panels at the Detroit Historical Museum marking the Fifth Estate 50th anniversary Finnish language weekly edition a hundred years ago with a circulation of 30,000 in the north country of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. Many papers that began in the 1960s, such as this publication, carried the vision of simultaneous World Revolution and Age of Aquarius in their pages. They exuded rage against a murderous and unjust system, and a joy at a new found culture based on love, ex- perimentation, and joy. However, most of this crashed as rapidly and completely as the demise of the Passenger Pigeon beginning with the inexplicable 1972 presidential re- election of the war criminal, Richard Nixon, the end of the military draft and combat in Vietnam by U.S. forces, and sheer exhaustion on the part of a move- ment of resistance mostly propelled by young people in their teens and twenties. By 1974, most of the papers had ceased to exist, but the Fif#h Estate valiantly continued on, attempt- ing to reinvent itself as a precursor of the now ubiq- uitous hip weeklies while still maintaining its radical edge. t a point of near financial collapse of the FE in 1975, several people formerly associated with the paper constituting themselves as the Eat The Rich Gang, stepped into the breach left by the al- most complete disappearance of the former staff. They immediately published what the front page headline announced as the “Last Issue.” ‘The supporting article explained that the paper would no longer accept commercial advertisements or pay salaries, and that the editorial commitment was shifting back to its original ideas. Or, in the words of an a 1971 FBI report: “The Fif#/ Estate sup- ports the cause of revolution everywhere.” Nicely put, With the anarchists of generations before, we maintain their vision of The Ideal, the new society they carried in their hearts.

The reason that 499 other papers ceased publish- ing was because they had essentially run their course. The Fifth Estate continued to print because the Eat the Rich Gang and, hence, the publication, became infused with radical ideas discovered by them of ul- tra-leftism, council communism, and anarchism. The influence of Fredy Perlman, Jacque Camatte, Jean Beaudrillard, and others continue to define Fif#Ż Estate perspectives today although usually not direct- ly espoused as they were in these pages in the mid- to late-1970s. ontrary to the previous period when content was driven by action and a revolutionary optimism, the new theories read by the publishing collective in the 1970s, existed mostly on an intellectual level with sectarian debate and denunciations of authoritarian leftists appearing frequently. It seemed as though the total domination of capi- tal had been achieved with the defeat of its ostensible main rivals of socialism and communism. The under- standing was cold comfort to the staff as it left the Fifth Estates new ideas and the articles it generated extremely marginalized. However, as critiques of civilization and indus- trialism began to take shape in these pages, and an opposition of radical ecology arose in the 1980s, the paper and its staff began active participation in cam- paigns against nuclear power, war, and assaults on the environment. With the re-emergence of a vibrant anarchist movement in the 1990s, the Fif#Ż/ Estate found a mi- lieu in which there was a general feeling of solidar-', 'FIFTH ESTATE ifth Estate w 9 yhibitat the F ng “Christ\\'s announC ?

The FE continues its tradition of reporting on the disruptions and challenges to the toxic routines of industrial civilization, the economy of capitalism, and its administrative apparatus, the political state. With the anarchists of generations before, we maintain their vision of The Ideal, the new society they carried in their hearts. But, we also explore new liberatory ideas knowing that the future can write itself in struggle. ut, back to the question of being not only recognized, but honored by mainstream institutions. Frankly, it was a bit surprising, particularly having a radical paper displayed at the Detroit Historical Museum, a centerpiece in the city’s cultural center since 1928. It’s a wonderful facility which chronicles the rich history of the urban area, so presenting our story wasn\\'t as far a reach as it initially seemed. The Fifth Estate exhibit stands in the center of the main gallery, and features seven vertical panels tracing the paper\\'s origins, mostly remaining in the time frame of 1960 and ‘70s radical nostalgia. However, it also announces very clearly the magazine’s current existence as an anarchist publication. There are photographs of marches with demonstrators car- rying Viet Cong flags, an array of front covers including ones of kids throwing bottles at cops, and calls for revolution, plus a large reproduction of a current edition. We wondered whether there would be a right-wing back- lash against the exhibit much in the same manner that fol- lowed the installation of the Diego Rivera “Detroit Industry” murals in the early 1930s at the near-by Detroit Institute of Arts. But so far the FE exhibit has been featured on radio and TV programs without any protest. Overall, the presentation is gorgeous, thanks to the in- credible commitment and skill of the museum staff, and will remain in place until August 2016. The museum printed 10,000 8 1⁄2 X 5 1⁄2 postcards to promote the exhibit! A half mile away from this exhibit is another devoted to the Fifth Estate at the Museum of Contemporary Art De- troit (MOCAD). This 4-room exhibition mostly features the paper’s graphic content, which is what has always made its articles come alive. Its presentation has a more radical cast to it and although there are many artifacts from the earlier period, a visitor is met immediately by a poster announcing, “Love & Anarchy: The Only Way.” There is the FE’s infamous forgery of a Detroit daily news- paper displayed with the headline, “Christs Body Found: Easter Cancelled,” our famous “Fuck Authority” poster, one stating, “Fuck the Draft,” as well as other items exemplifying the paper\\'s radical past and present. None of the “F” bomb posters made it into the more staid Detroit Historical Muse- um, we were told, since public school classes often visit there. The museum hosted well-attended panels on “Art as Po- litical Force,” and another on the politics of the FE. he MOCAD exhibition is in a museum facility be- hind the main building named the Mike Kelly Mobil\n",

            "['CHapTER TWO Background and Data This chapter provides a brief summary of the major provisions of the Massachusetts reform bill and describes the data sources used to examine the reform’s impact on hospital care. It also pro- vides some basic statistics on WC in Massachusetts that may be helpful in situating this state relative to other parts of the country. The hospital data are used to demonstrate that the reform reduced the share of patients without insurance and changed the mix of payers. 2.1 Massachusetts’s Health Care Reform In April 2006, after substantial legislative debate in the latter part of 2005 and early 2006, Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney signed a statute implementing a package of health care reform measures.1 Massachusetts’s reform efforts were primarily organized around five key pro- visions. First, the new law introduced, as of July 1, 2007, an individual mandate requiring tax filers to demonstrate proof of insurance coverage or face a tax penalty.2 Second, the law imple- mented an employer mandate requiring businesses with 11 or more employees to offer insurance plans that met certain provisions for coverage and take-up to their employees or face a fine of $295 per worker. Third, the law implemented a state-run health insurance exchange called the Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector. One of the Connector’s primary purposes was to reduce problems of adverse selection by pooling those who had previously sought coverage through the individual and small-group insurance markets. Fourth, the plan implemented a state-subsidized low-cost insurance plan called Commonwealth Care; this plan was designed to provide coverage to individuals or families that had more income than would qualify them for Medicaid but that might otherwise be unable to afford private health insurance. Finally, the plan included Medicaid expansions that broadened the allowable income ranges for MassHealth, the state’s Medicaid program, and otherwise expanded eligibility. One reason the Massachusetts reform has been widely studied by health policy research- ers is that PPACA also includes an individual mandate, employer mandate, health insurance exchanges, subsidized low-cost plans, and Medicaid expansions. Thus, broadly speaking, the five main provisions in the Massachusetts reform are included in the national reform, although the details of how each element is implemented differ somewhat across the two reform pack- 1 Chapter 58 of the Acts of 2006, 2006. A number of more comprehensive discussions of the specifics of the Massachu- setts reform exist, including Raymond, 2007, and Bianchi, 2008. 2 The penalty could be waived if filers demonstrated financial hardship that precluded them from purchasing coverage, and the size of the penalty was linked to Commonwealth Connector premiums. In 2008, the penalty for individual filers ranged from $17.50 to $76 per month of uninsurance, depending on the age and income of the filer. 5', '6 The Impact of Health Care Reform on Workers’ Compensation Medical Care: Evidence from Massachusetts ages.3 PPACA contains some additional measures—such as a requirement that insurers spend a certain fraction of revenues on care and a tax subsidy for small businesses that provide insurance—that were not included in the Massachusetts reform. One important difference between the Massachusetts health care reform and PPACA occurs in the area of cost containment. The Massachusetts law does not contain specific cost control provisions.4 Although cost containment provisions in PPACA are limited, they do exist, most notably the establishment of the IPAB. 2.2 Massachusetts’s Workers’ Compensation System The WC system in Massachusetts is primarily funded through commercial insurance, with regulatory oversight by the Massachusetts Department of Industrial Accidents (DIA), Division of Insurance, Workers’ Compensation Rating and Inspection Bureau, and Workers’ Compen- sation Advisory Council. Employer premiums are determined through an administered pric- ing system; average premiums in 2006 were $1.70 per $100 of payroll, making Massachusetts 47th in the nation in premiums (Reinke and Manley, 2006). In thinking about how Massachusetts’s experience with health reform and WC might translate to other contexts, it is helpful to consider how the state’s WC system performs rela- tive to that of other states across a few basic metrics.

Workplace injuries and illnesses per 100 full-time private workers', 'Background and Data 7 between 2004 and 2008. Over the period during which reform was enacted and implemented in Massachusetts, recorded workplace injuries declined both in that state and in the nation as a whole; this decline represents a continuation of the trend in improved worker safety that has persisted for several decades. Although the pace of decline in Massachusetts mirrored that of the nation, it is notable that Massachusetts has consistently experienced the lowest per capita rates of workplace injury among the New England states and that its injury rate is below the national average. Measures of WC claim activity have also declined in Massachusetts in recent years. Figure 2.2, for example, plots the number of First Report of Injury forms received by the DIA5— a proxy for the number of WC claims—between 2002 and 2010. These aggregate data do not appear to provide strong evidence for or against the notion that health care reform may have affected WC claiming: There was a larger than typical decline in filings between 2006 and 2007 as the reform was implemented, but the beginning of the decline predates the reform, and claims have also declined since 2008, suggesting that aggregate claim rates may have been impacted by other factors. As a comparison, Davis and Bar-Chaim (2011) estimate that WC claim frequency dropped by 15.3 percent nationally between 2005 and 2009, whereas the DIA data indicate a 16.7 percent decline over the same period in Massachusetts.

RAND TR1216-2.2 5 Employers are required to make these filings after receiving notice of any injury that is allegedly work related and inca- pacitates an employee from earning full wages for a period of five calendar days, criteria that would generally qualify the employee for WC payments. Compliance with this requirement is high, and employers found to be noncompliant are sub- ject to fines. Number of new injury filings (thousands)', '8 The Impact of Health Care Reform on Workers’ Compensation Medical Care: Evidence from Massachusetts In addition to having lower than average injury rates, Massachusetts appears to have lower rates of utilization and provider reimbursement across several metrics compared with many other states. Table 2.1, for example, reports the average number of visits and the average amount paid to various types of medical providers for WC claims by state. These averages are computed by the Workers Compensation Research Institute (WCRI) from data on individual claims compiled for each state. In general, both measures of utilization and average expen- ditures per claim are lower in Massachusetts relative to neighboring states and the median state monitored by WCRI. In some cases, the differences are fairly substantial—for example, although virtually all claims in all states involve a physician visit, payments to physicians in Massachusetts are 40 percent lower than average. In Massachusetts, hospital payments made by WC insurers, as with all medical care received through the WC system, are guided by a WC fee schedule published by the Division of Health Care Finance and Policy. However, insurers, employers, and health care providers are permitted to negotiate alternative rates, so the schedule is not controlling. The state’s fee schedule is set through a regulatory hearing process and has been adjusted fairly infrequently; over the time period covered by this study, a single fee schedule was in place. Comparing WC reimbursements offered to medical providers for particular services to reimbursements available through Medicare provides one way to assess the relative generos- ity of fee schedules in different states. Coomer and Liu (2010) report that as of 2009, the WC reimbursement rate for a representative market basket of medical services was 8 percent above the Medicare reimbursement rate in Massachusetts, making Massachusetts the least generous Table 2.1 Average Physician Utilization and Payments in WC Claims, by State, 2008–2009 New 16-State Measure Massachusetts Jersey Pennsylvania Median average number of visits per claim to: physician 7.2 8.7 10.9 9.8 Chiropractor 1.2 0.2 1.8 0.8 physical/occupational therapist 5.2 10.6 9.6 7.5 Hospital outpatient provider 6.4 3.0 6.5 3.9 Other medical provider 2.6 3.1 3.8 3.7 average medical payment (in $) per claim to: physician 2,166 5,115 2,987 3,562 Chiropractor 77 25 229 74 physical/occupational therapist 439 1,336 1,259 1,017 Hospital outpatient provider 1,752 2,227 2,573 2,645 Other medical provider 338 739 698 658 SOURCE: WCRI, 2012.

The state’s Medicaid expansion — called Healthy Michigan and implemented under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) — currently provides coverage to over 668,000 low-income Michiganders while also providing economic benefits to the state and reducing uncompensated care for hospitals and other safety net providers.1 But Michigan is putting this well-documented success in jeopardy with its proposal to both impose higher premiums on Medicaid expansion beneficiaries and to take away their coverage if they don’t meet work requirements. Research shows that Michigan’s expansion has: • Cut Michigan’s uninsured rate in half since expansion began in April 2014. • Made working and searching for work easier. In beneficiary surveys, half of non-working adults reported that having Medicaid made it easier to look for work, and nearly 70 percent of those already working said Medicaid made it easier to work or made them better at their job. • Improved access to care, as well as detection of serious health conditions and management of chronic health conditions, particularly among beneficiaries who were previously uninsured. • Improved beneficiaries’ physical health, consistent with nationwide data. • Improved financial health. After enrolling, Healthy Michigan enrollees had less medical debt, less debt being sent to collectors, and less debt that is past due. • Provided economic benefits for state and hospital budgets. Medicaid expansion has contributed to improvements in Michigan’s economy by creating jobs, bringing in more tax revenue, and cutting in half the amount of uncompensated care for safety net providers. 1 State of Michigan, Healthy Michigan Plan Enrollment Statistics as of October 15, 2018, https://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/0,5885,7-339-71547_2943_66797---,00.html. 1', 'Michigan is proposing to take Medicaid away from expansion beneficiaries for not meeting work requirements, and to impose higher premiums on them, through an amendment to its current 1115 Medicaid demonstration, or “waiver.” The proposal will likely lead to significant coverage losses and add new costs to the state’s budget. The Michigan House Fiscal Agency estimates that up to 54,000 Michiganders would lose Medicaid coverage through implementation of the state’s proposal to take Medicaid away from people who don’t meet the work requirement.2 And recent evidence from Arkansas suggests coverage losses could be even greater, given the thousands who have already lost coverage in that state as a result of similar requirements, and the difficulty in reporting compliance with them.3 Section 1115 of the Social Security Act allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to approve demonstration projects that promote Medicaid’s objectives. A “central objective” of Medicaid is providing affordable coverage to people who would otherwise be uninsured, a federal court recently noted in vacating the approval of a Kentucky waiver that included a work requirement and new premiums. Michigan’s waiver, which would lead to significant coverage losses and undermine the gains the state has made in the health and financial well-being of low-income Michiganders, likewise fails to promote Medicaid’s objectives. Michigan’s Successful Medicaid Expansion Healthy Michigan began in April 2014 under the authority of a section 1115 waiver, enabling over 1 million Michiganders with incomes below 138 percent of the poverty line who were previously uninsured or underinsured to gain coverage.4 Like Medicaid expansion nationwide, Healthy Michigan has led to significant progress in cutting Michigan’s uninsured rate, improving access to care and the physical and financial health of Medicaid beneficiaries, and generating revenue and other economic benefits by strengthening the state’s budget and hospital budgets:5 2 Michigan House Fiscal Agency, “Legislative Analysis on Healthy Michigan Work Requirements and Premium Payment Requirements,” June 6, 2018, http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2017-2018/billanalysis/House/pdf/2017- HLA-0897-5CEEF80A.pdf. 3 Jennifer Wagner, “4,109 More Arkansans Lost Medicaid in October for Not Meeting Rigid Work Requirements,” Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, October 16, 2018, https://www.cbpp.org/blog/4109-more-arkansans-lost- medicaid-in-october-for-not-meeting-rigid-work-requirements. 4 State of Michigan, “Section 1115 Demonstration Extension Application: Healthy Michigan Plan (Project No. 11-W- 00245/5),” September 10, 2018, https://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Information/By- Topics/Waivers/1115/downloads/mi/mi-healthy-michigan-pa3.pdf. Michigan’s Medicaid expansion requires beneficiaries to make monthly payments, which are based on the average co-payments for services used in the previous six months, into a health savings account. In addition to these monthly payments, beneficiaries with incomes between 100 and 138 percent of the poverty level must pay monthly premiums set at 2 percent of their incomes. 5 For more information on the benefits of Medicaid expansion, see Larisa Antonisse et al., “The Effects of Medicaid Expansion under the ACA: Updated Findings from a Literature Review,” Kaiser Family Foundation, March 28, 2018, https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/the-effects-of-medicaid-expansion-under-the-aca-updated-findings-from-a- literature-review-march-2018/, and Government Accountability Office, “Medicaid: Access to Health Care for Low- Income Adults in States with and without Expanded Eligibility,” October 15, 2018, https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-18-607. 2', '• Uninsured rate cut in half. Michigan’s uninsured rate has decreased by 50 percent overall and by at least 40 percent in all but one of the state’s counties since the state implemented Healthy Michigan in 2014.6 Wayne County, which includes Detroit, has seen a 55 percent drop, while rural Alpena and Gogebic counties have seen drops of 56 and 52 percent, respectively. (See Figure 1.) FIGURE 1 • Makes work and searching for a job easier. In a survey of beneficiaries, over half of non- working adults reported that Medicaid makes it easier to look for work, while nearly 70 percent of working adults said Medicaid made it easier to work or made them better at their jobs.7 (See Figure 2.) 6 Susan Dorr Goold and Jeffrey Kullgren, “Report on the 2016 Healthy Michigan Voices Enrollee Survey,” University of Michigan Institute for Healthcare Policy & Innovation, January 17, 2018, https://www.michigan.gov/documents/mdhhs/2016_Healthy_Michigan_Voices_Enrollee_Survey_- _Report__Appendices_1.17.18_final_618161_7.pdf. 7 Institute for Healthcare Policy & Innovation, “Medicaid Expansion Helped Enrollees Do Better at Work or in Job Searches,” University of Michigan, June 27, 2017, http://ihpi.umich.edu/news/medicaid-expansion-helped-enrollees- do-better-work-or-job-searches. 3', 'One study of Michigan’s Medicaid FIGURE 2 expansion showed that more than half of working expansion beneficiaries had a serious physical health condition such as heart disease, asthma, or diabetes, and 25 percent had a mental health condition, often depression.8 When conditions like diabetes, heart disease, or depression are treated and controlled, individuals with these conditions may be able to hold a steady job. For example, a long-term randomized trial found that providing older adults with regular care for heart disease increased their earnings, likely by reducing their time out of work due to illness.9 In contrast, if chronic conditions are untreated, work may become impossible. Work requirements can create a vicious cycle in which health setbacks lead to job loss, which in turn leads to loss of access to treatment, making it difficult or impossible to manage health and regain employment. • Improved access to care. Primary care providers surveyed by Healthy Michigan evaluators, including physicians and nurse practitioners, reported that Medicaid expansion has improved access to care, detection of serious health conditions, and management of chronic health conditions, particularly among beneficiaries who were previously uninsured.10 The increase in the number of Medicaid beneficiaries did not result in less access to care. The share of health clinics accepting new Medicaid patients increased slightly following Medicaid expansion; and increased appointment availability measured four months following the implementation of expansion remained one year after expansion, one study showed.11 8 Renuka Tipirneni, Susan D.

            "['APPENDIX B. CASE STUDIES FROM THE COMMUNITY STUDY Indianapolis, Indiana CONTEXT AND HISTORY Market Composition and Competition The highly competitive environment in Indianapolis has been feeding expansion activity in the four private hospital systems, which have all been expanding their facilities both within Indianapolis and into the surrounding suburbs. Clarian Health Partners led the charge into the suburbs, followed by Community Health Network, St. Vincent’s Health System, and St. Francis Hospitals & Health Centers. Wishard Health Services, a county-owned hospital and network of community clinics is the main safety net provider. An increased number of uninsured patients has caused Wishard to implement cost-cutting measures, such as increased copayments, staff reduction, and more aggressive bill collection from third-party payers. As the insurer for several large Indianapolis-based companies, Anthem BlueCross BlueShield is the dominant health insurer in the market. Meanwhile, national insurers United Healthcare, Aetna, and Humana have been gaining membership at the expense of provider- owned local insurers, such as M-Plan and Advantage Health Solutions. Economic Environment in Indianapolis The large employers in the Indianapolis region include Eli Lilly, General Motors, Marsh Supermarkets, and St. Vincent’s Health. They have struggled with containment of health care costs and are now shifting costs toward employees and focusing on developing tiered provider networks. The concern is that health care costs seen in Indianapolis and the state are higher than those in other regions in neighboring states, which may affect future business development. In the following sections, we describe patient safety activities in the hospital, ambulatory and long-term care sectors, characterize the views of local stakeholders, and then conclude with key lessons learned from the Indianapolis experience. CURRENT COMMUNITY COLLABORATIONS Indianapolis Coalition for Patient Safety The key patient safety initiative in Indianapolis is the Indianapolis Coalition for Patient Safety (ICPS), which operates within the hospital sector. Begun in 2003, the ICPS brings together the six major hospital systems in the metropolitan Indianapolis area. The systems are Clarian Health, Community Health Network, Richard L. Roudebush VA Medical Center, St. Francis Hospitals & Health Centers, St. Vincent Health, and Wishard Health Services. What grew into the ICPS began in 2001 as discussions between the chief executive officers (CEOs) of the major health systems. The CEOs were motivated by To Err Is Human, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report. The ICPS currently is considering expansion to include the hospital systems in the suburban ring around Indianapolis. Major overarching goals of the ICPS include making Indianapolis the “safest city (for patients) in the country,” “not to compete on safety,” and to bring a high degree of standardization to practices across all participating health systems. The last goal was crucial, 105', \"given that a large number of patients receive care in multiple systems and a large number of providers cross systems as well. The initial goals of working together were very broad and largely educational in scope. However, within a short time, and with the assistance of an outside facilitator, the group decided to initiate specific collaborative patient safety improvement activities across the six member hospital systems. The choice of initiatives was highly influenced by external organizations, among them the Joint Commission, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) 100,000 Lives and 5 Million Lives campaigns. The initial set of ICPS initiatives has occupied the member hospitals since the inception of the coalition. It includes a standard practice for surgical-site markings and surgical timeouts, improving patient safety related to high-alert medications, such as anticoagulants and insulin, and the implementation of a standard policy for “do not use” abbreviations. Patient safety initiatives that are in early stages or on the horizon include medication reconciliation and standardized patient-identification practices. Having set the tone for cooperation and collaboration, the six CEOs also brought their high level administrators (chief medical officers, chief nursing officers, and directors of patient safety and pharmacy) into the coalition as active participants. These individuals play a critical role in setting priorities for the coalition, implementing specific initiatives, and engaging their hospital staff to participate and make the necessary behavior changes. The success of specific initiatives is also aided in many cases by physician and nurse champions at the individual hospitals who interact with and motivate front-line staff. The stakeholders interviewed identified several factors that contributed to ICPS’s success. One early key factor was the financial and in-kind support provided by Eli Lilly, whose headquarters are in Indianapolis. Lilly’s support included devoting staff time to coordinating meetings, hosting meetings and providing office space—providing “neutral ground” for the coalition members to meet and support for coordination activities. Lilly involvement with the ICPS has declined in recent years, but it still is involved in patient safety initiatives. For instance, Lilly has provided grants to hospitals to work on specific patient safety initiatives and also offered the assistance of several LEAN/Six Sigma Black Belts to work with hospitals on various projects. One example is a project at Wishard Health Services in which they analyzed the insulin-delivery and -administration process “from the receiving dock to the patient's bedside.” Along the way, safety risks and process-improvement steps were identified and subsequently implemented. To accomplish the goals of specific initiatives selected by the ICPS, the members have developed a collaborative model that they feel has greatly contributed to success in changing practices within their individual hospitals. For each initiative selected, each hospital puts forward the high level administrators from their hospitals who are most knowledgeable about the practice area. These six form the cross-system workgroup. That workgroup meets regularly to review relevant empirical evidence on the practice and the experience of others who have implemented it, share information about the current practice at their own individual hospitals, and then determines what the standard of practice should be for all the ICPS hospitals. Hospital representatives with whom we spoke reported that the role of the workgroup has been critical to the success of these individual initiatives. The workgroup determines the general practice, but each hospital has the flexibility to implement the practice in a way that best fits in 106\", 'its setting. Interviewees believed that to enforce a “cookie-cutter” approach (that forces the member hospitals to have identical policies and procedures) would impede the hospitals from being able to successfully implement the necessary changes, given their unique characteristics (such as hospital size, staffing, patient population, and location). Indiana Patient Safety Center Another patient safety coalition active in the community is the statewide Indiana Patient Safety Center (IPSC). The IPSC was formed on July 1, 2006, with the mission to facilitate “the development of safe and reliable health care systems that prevent harm to patients across Indiana.” Housed at the Indiana Hospital and Health Association’s offices, the IPSC is funded by a portion of hospitals’ association membership dues and is staffed by the hospital association. It is pursuing designation as a Patient Safety Organization (PSO). Members of the center include the state’s medical schools, the Quality Improvement Organization (QIO), the medical associations, and research institutes, including Purdue University Regenstrief Center for Healthcare Engineering. The work of the IPSC spans the state and the range of health care settings. For example, in the first year of the center’s operation, the staff worked on coordinating statewide efforts to improve the safety of healthcare delivery systems, conducted assessments of clinicians’ perceptions of patient safety culture in their organization, and fostered participation in the IHI 5 Million Lives Campaign. An upcoming focus will be to work on a pressure ulcer-prevention initiative involving long-term care settings, along with the state health department and QIO. Additionally, the center is working toward developing, or enabling the development of, regional patient safety coalitions through the state. HOSPITAL ACTIVITIES In Indianapolis, patient safety quickly became a top priority for the six large hospital systems that dominate the market. Hospital systems are clearly the dominant player in patient safety in Indianapolis. The six hospitals involved in the ICPS have agreed that, while they compete for market share in other ways, they will not compete on safety. Since ICPS’s inception, the members have completed, or are well on their way to completing, several patient safety initiatives and have put systems in place to monitor the improvements and ensure that the improvements are sustained. In other words, the initiatives will never completely end but will continue to be monitored and will evolve into new activities. Hospitals in the ICPS have experienced many benefits from their participation, including pooled resources and economies of scale by bringing together staff from all the organizations to collaborate on common issues and goals, and highly valued ICPS support to the members when an error occurs. For instance, one of the member hospitals experienced a tragic error when several newborns died from being given an adult dose of heparin. All the ICPS hospitals “rallied around” the\n",

Clinical laboratory & pathology', '4.1 General description of the unit The purpose of the pathology and laboratory medicine unit is to perform accurate testing in a timely fashion on patient samples and to analyse and interpret the results, thereby guiding the diagnosis, treatment and management of the patient. The intention is to provide these results based on examination of the patient’s cells, tissues, blood and other body fluids, while ensuring the safety of personnel, public and patients. Timeliness, accuracy of results, quality management and universal safety are critical elements in medicine and in the safe functioning of the pathology and laboratory medicine unit. The Pathology laboratory handles tissues, body fluids and other specimen types. Specimens submitted for pathologic examination may be solid tissues from surgical excisions or biopsies (histopathology) or cells in smears, scrapings or fluid specimens (cytopathology). The significance of the pathology laboratory (in its broadest terms) is that in many cases, patient management is based on a definitive histologic or cytologic diagnosis, especially in the case of neoplasms. Future management of a patient depends on an assessment of various pathologic parameters including the histopathologic type of tumour, its grade, its extent and its stage and additional ancillary studies which insure correct treatment or inform prognosis. A complete and detailed examination of the excised tissues is therefore critical, especially in this age of personalized medicine. To ensure that all specimens are appropriately handled, guidelines and standard operating procedures must be in place for the handling of all specimens. This will prevent misdiagnosis, save time, anxiety and possible harm. Tissues must be handled appropriately, immediately after collection by the clinician, so that the quality of the tissues available does not deteriorate and optimum preservation is maintained for accurate diagnoses and possible biomarker testing. Effective timely communication, however, is not just crucial in reporting of pathology results, but also is vital for exchange of information about the patient and their management at all points during the pathway of care. In addition, the clinical laboratories (laboratory medicine) provide testing in haematology, chemistry, immunology, and microbiology that are also essential for diagnosis and management of many diseases including cancers. 4.2 Priority medical devices for clinical laboratory The following tables present general medical devices for clinical laboratory medicine, which can be used for screening, diagnosis, staging, and follow-up of many diseases including several cancers, and specific medical devices, which are used for interventions for specific cancer types. The following tables present the priority medical devices required to perform the following health interventions: Cancer type Interventions All cancers • Pre-analytical procedure: phlebotomy, sample reception and distribution • General analytical procedures • Blood chemistry tests (liver and renal function tests, alkaline phosphatase and calcium) • Tumour lysis syndrome panel: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), uric acid, potassium (K), Calcium (Ca), Phosphate • Complete blood count (CBC) - total white blood count with differential, platelet count, and haemoglobin level and red blood cell indices • Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) panel: D-dimer, fibrinogen, prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT) • Urine free light chains • Serum free light chains • Serum protein electrophoresis • Immunoassay test Breast • Biomarker analysis cancer Cervical • Baseline CD4 count test (for HIV(+) patients) cancer • HPV Test 90 WHO list of priority medical devices for cancer management', 'Cancer type Interventions Colorectal • Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) test cancer • Faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) • Guaiac faecal occult blood test (gFOBT) Leukaemia • Bone marrow aspiration • Bone marrow biopsy • Cerebrospinal fluid aspi\n",

In the second half of the twentieth century, large groups of immigrants came from a limited number of countries. Many migrants came from former colonies, such as India, Pakistan and the West Indies to the UK, Algeria and West Africa to France, and Suriname and the former Netherlands Antilles to the Netherlands. Large groups also came as labour migrants to Western Europe, in particular from Turkey and the Maghreb. This we call the “traditional diversity.” In the twenty-first century, smaller groups are coming from a very large variety of countries. Migrants come from all over the globe to Western Europe, from EU countries, such as Poland, Bulgaria and Germany, from Syria, Eritrea and Iran, but also from the former Soviet republics, India and China. Many come to work, others come as refugees, or as students. This we call the “new diversity.” The traditional migrant groups were relatively homogeneous in socio- economic terms. Many were low skilled, had low levels of literacy, and came from rural areas outside Europe. The “new” migration is much more heterogeneous. Among them are well educated professionals, with high incomes and urban life styles, but also low skilled labour migrants who work in rural areas, or semi-literate refugees from Sub-Saharan Africa. Some come to stay, but large percentages leave within five years. This “new diversity” can be observed across Western Europe (Castles, De Haas, & Miller, 2014). Steven Vertovec (2007, p. 1024) has called it “super- diversity”: the “new, small and scattered, multiple-origin, transnationally', '208 mArk bovEns, roEl JEnnissEn, GodFriEd EnGbErsEn And mEikE bokhorsT connected, socio-economically differentiated and legally stratified” nature of international migration. This super-diversity is a new chapter in the history of migration to Western Europe, with new challenges for social cohesion and public governance. In this paper we will use the case of the Netherlands to illustrate this transformation of migration and society. The Netherlands is fairly representa- tive of Western Europe. It experienced post-colonial immigration in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, as did Belgium, France, the UK, Spain and Portugal. It saw large waves of labour and family migration in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, as did Belgium, Luxemburg, France, Germany, Switzerland and Austria.2 And from the 1990s onwards it has experienced a wave of post-industrial migration, consisting of refugees, intra-EU migrants, and highly skilled workers, as have Germany, Sweden, the UK, Switzerland and Austria (White, 1993; Jennissen, Van Wissen, & Van der Gaag, 2006). Some Western European countries, such as the UK, France, Belgium, Luxemburg, Sweden and Switzerland, are probably even more diverse than the Netherlands. Others, such as Ireland, Finland, Norway, Italy, Spain and Greece, are less diverse. An advantage of the Netherlands is also that very large and accurate data sets are available on the ethnic composition of neighbourhoods, municipalities and regions. Firstly, we will provide more empirical details about this new diversity and show that this diversity differs greatly across the country. Some municipalities are characterised by the traditional forms of diversity, others by “super- diversity,” and some are only slightly affected by migration. This means that a “one size fits all” policy approach does not make much sense. Secondly, we found that higher levels of ethnic heterogeneity coincide with lower levels of social cohesion. In the final part of the paper, we will present an agenda for public governance and public administration. 2 Increasing ethnic diversity in the population In the Netherlands, the proportion of residents with a migration background3 in the population has risen considerably in the last few decades – from 9.2% in 1972 to 23.1% in 2019. Moreover, the group of residents with a migration background is becoming increasingly diverse. These days, only one-third of migrants living in the Netherlands belong to the traditional migrant com- munities, while the remaining two-thirds come from a wide range of other countries of origin. In 2017, the migrants living in the Netherlands hailed from 222 different countries of origin.4', 'ThE nEW divErsiT Y: incrEAsinG EThnic hETEroGEnEiT Y And iTs consEquEncEs 209 Interestingly enough, people are often unaware of this increased ethnic diversity. Policy documents and studies on immigration and integration con- tinue to focus on traditional post-colonial and migrant worker communities, i.e. on citizens with a Surinamese, Moroccan or Turkish background. A few groups of refugees and Polish labour migrants may occasionally also receive a share of the attention. Furthermore, a rather rough distinction between “Western” and “non-Western” migrants is often made in policy documents. This traditional perspective on migration and integration does not fit the empirical reality of the twenty-first century. If we keep seeing migration through 1970s migrant-worker glasses or through post-colonial glasses, we will see only migrants from the traditional countries of origin and from poorly defined categories in which many migrants are lumped together, such as “from Western countries” and “from non-Western countries.” This is shown in the circle on the left in Figure 1. Once we let go of our traditional frameworks and look at things as they are now, we will see a multitude of new groups, as shown in the circle on the right in Figure 1. Figure 1 T raditional and new perspectives on diversity among inhabitants © WRR 2018 | Source: Statistics Netherlands By acknowledging that today’s migration situation is much more diverse, we can do greater justice to the wide ethnic diversity of migrants living in society. The traditional countries of origin are no longer in the top 15 countries with the most significant positive net immigration rates (more immigrants than emigrants). During the 2007–2016 period, in the Netherlands, this top 15 was as follows: Poles, Syrians, people from the former Soviet Union,', '210 mArk bovEns, roEl JEnnissEn, GodFriEd EnGbErsEn And mEikE bokhorsT Bulgarians, Chinese, Indians, Romanians, Italians, Germans, Somalis, Eritreans, Spaniards, Hungarians, Greeks and Iranians (see Figure 2). As a matter of fact, the traditional groups had negative migration rates – they had more emigrants than immigrants. Figure 2 T op 15 countries supplying the greatest number of migrants (net migration), the Netherlands, 2007–2016 © WRR 2018 | Source: Statistics Netherlands Another reason why the Netherlands is becoming increasingly ethnically diverse is that birth rates tend to be higher for residents with a migration background than for the native population. At the same time, mortality rates for residents with a migration background tend to be lower, since migrants tend to be younger than the average resident. After a generation, the birth and mortality rates of migrant communities tend to conform to those of the country in which they have settled. However, we are still a long way from reaching that point. This means that Dutch society will continue to grow more diverse over the next few decades, even if we were to completely ban immigration starting from today. This sustained increase in the ethnic diversity rate is reflected in Statistics Netherlands’ population projection. Figure 3 shows that the proportion of representatives of the four traditional emigration countries in the Dutch population will continue to increase slightly until the mid-twenty-first century,', 'ThE nEW divErsiT Y: incrEAsinG EThnic hETEroGEnEiT Y And iTs consEquEncEs 211 after which it will stop growing. The projection mainly shows that the share of the highly diverse group of people with a non-European/non-Anglo- Saxon background will continue to increase significantly. Starting from the 2040s, this group will outnumber the traditional “big four”: citizens with a Surinamese, Moroccan, Turkish and Antillean background. The diverse group of people with a European or Anglo-Saxon migration background will continue to represent a larger share of the population as well. Figure 3 S hare of people in the Netherlands with a migration background, 1996–2060 © WRR 2018 | Source: Statistics Netherlands 3 Large variety between and within municipalities We calculated how ethnically diverse Dutch municipalities and neighbour- hoods are. We started by subdividing all the residents of the Netherlands into 18 groups, reflecting 18 different ethnic backgrounds. Needless to say, the largest of these groups consists of “native Dutch” people. This group comprises nearly 80% of Dutch society. In addition, we distinguished 17 other groups based on country of origin, e.g. Turkey, Morocco, Anglo-Saxon countries, Arab countries, Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, etc. We then calculated a diversity index for all Dutch neighbourhoods, municipalities and regions, the so-called Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). This is expressed as a number between 0 and 1 that indicates the likelihood that two random sample people', '212 mArk bovEns, roEl JEnnissEn, GodFriEd EnGbErsEn And mEikE bokhorsT from a given area belong to groups that have different ethnic backgrounds. The higher the index the greater this likelihood. In other words, a low HHI denotes great homogeneity, whereas a high HHI denotes heterogeneity. The mean HHI for the Netherlands is 0.38. However, as Figure 4 shows, the index considerably differs from municipality to municipality.

            "['1A Rallying Cry for Refocusing the European Union', '2Europe’s political leaders need to take much faster action on three huge, transnational, and interconnected challenges. These challenges are already on their doorstep: climate change, aging populations, and digital revolutions (hereafter called the “Big 3”). They are already altering the lives of Europeans in ways that could break the long-standing social contract between citizens and state, damaging both democracy and well-being. The European Union has a vital role to play in managing these challenges, but to do so successfully, it will have to change its priorities, refocus its resources and policies, and create the necessary political will.', 'EUROPE’S POLITICAL DEBATES are currently focused on single-issue problems 3 that have largely divided people into defensive tribes. Populists have turned migration into Europe’s single biggest political challenge. There are indeed complex issues that migration policy needs to address, but the attention devoted to them is all out of proportion and comes at the expense of other pressing issues. Meanwhile, most mainstream parties have run out of new ideas to meet voters’ fears about jobs, identity, and security. This misdirection of political energy is self-defeating and paralyzing. A new vision is needed to break the political impasses preventing rapid progress in addressing the major changes happening to planet, lifetime, and technology. Each one has already begun to transform economies, societies, politics, and physical environments and will increasingly affect current thinking around many other issues, including migration. These enormous, scary changes are hitting most parts of the world, but in different ways, making it hard for governments to make the necessary trade-offs between the long-term interests of all humans and the short-term interests of their own populations. Great political leadership is needed for the human race to make the necessary adaptations without major conflicts and violence. But no global power seems willing to lead a global response, and, in this respect, the European Union (EU) and its member states have a unique advantage. They have a regional governance structure that is better suited to manage the adaptation than individual governments or other forms of international cooperation. Europeans have developed institutions and policies that can manage trade-offs and tap into a political community with the capacity for collective problem-solving. That gives them unusually rich resources: a community of law, a community of political solidarity, and deep transnational networks of expertise across businesses, science and academia communities, civil society organizations, national administrations, and supranational institutions. If the EU successfully applies these resources to the Big 3 challenges, it could set global norms and provide political leadership on a scale that would help not only Europeans but also the rest of the world to adapt. The EU is not, by any means, the whole solution; national governments need to do the bulk of the adaptation, and business and civil society have big roles to play. But the EU offers five key advantages in addressing the looming transitions: Scale People can achieve things at the scale of half a billion that they cannot in smaller communities. But it is hard to scale up solutions if the incentive is not great enough for governments to collaborate rather than go it alone and to overcome other collective action problems. If the EU’s policy frameworks can bring together communities, they can achieve more at scale and overcome blockages to collective action.', '4 Open societies The EU has relatively well-educated people who are free to express their opinions in democratic debates and open media and to choose their identities and lifestyles. Europe’s deep networks of scientists and academics, businesspeople, civil society organizations, and state administrations have extensive expertise, knowledge, and practical experience. If the EU can pull together its collective intelligence and make its open societies and cultural diversity an asset, it could produce much better solutions to the problems created by the Big 3. Sticky agreements The EU’s community of law makes agreements stick. Unlike loose intergovernmental pacts that signatories can withdraw from on the whim of their political leader, the EU’s members are bound into a system with legal remedies and political pressure that makes it far more difficult to renege on agreements, even though governments will test the boundaries. If the EU can produce similarly sticky agreements on solutions to the Big 3, that will give everyone—from state actors to businesses—more certainty that EU agreements will hold, which sets firmer expectations and changes their behavior much faster than an international agreement alone would. Money The EU has a relatively small common budget, but it is big enough—at 1 percent of the EU’s gross domestic product (GDP)—to bring in additional resources when the economic and social pain of adaptation becomes too great for one democratic society to bear. The adaptation will create asymmetric shocks across Europe. If the EU can direct its common money toward providing buffers to ease the transition, it could help preserve democracy in struggling countries and maintain social peace in communities.', 'Global norms 5 The EU has the power to set global norms in the public interest, thanks to its sophisticated legal and political infrastructure and its administrative capacity to lead multilateral cooperation on the Big 3. At the transnational level, it has greater powers than other regional bodies to regulate competition, consumer policy and trade, and to protect consumers, workers, and the environment with product and process standards. The standards it sets for the EU’s large internal market of $20 trillion tend to get adopted by other economies trading with it. If the EU sets effective rules that serve the public interest, it could foster global norms capable of managing the shift to a low-carbon economy, the changes to social contracts, and the effects of digital products and services. These five advantages are vital to handling the transnational dimensions of the Big 3. The cross-border effects that could cause conflicts between states will need buffering through cooperation and mechanisms to spread the burden of adaptation. The EU has a community of governments and political elites that are used to working together and finding common ground. The EU’s trust-building political frameworks could be strengthened to prevent governments’ beggar-thy-neighbor reactions that often lead to interstate friction. In addition to keeping the peace within Europe, the collaboration could allow the EU to play a positive role in resolving interstate conflicts born from new pressures elsewhere in the world. We believe that the EU must use these resources really well to manage the coming transitions. Europeans have a historic opportunity to adapt to the inevitable reformation of economies, politics, and society. If they manage it successfully, the solutions they find also could help other parts of the world. If they manage it badly, the EU will have little purpose in the transformed Europe of the future. If misdirected, its resources could be at best wasted, and at worst they could be used to block the adaptation and lengthen the economic and social pain. The EU will wither if it is not used as the framework for this adaptation to the Big 3. The cost of missing this opportunity would be existential for the EU. Europeans will lose the capacity to shape their own future, suffer from a declining quality of life and more social unrest, and could even experience a return to violence. The aim of this report is not to justify the current EU, nor give it a future role for the benefit of the institutions or elites. Rather, it is to direct the resources of an institution with unique advantages at three of the greatest challenges facing humankind in the twenty-first century. These should be the EU’s focus for the foreseeable future.', '6 May Lucia and Peter’s daughter, 2019 Claudia, just turned twenty-one May and has a high quality of life that 2040 respects the planet’s limits.

            "['6 Europe’s choices Europe’s core political choices as we move deeper into the complex and connected world of the 21st Century are less limited. There is a richer field of opportunity for Europeans to explore. But it requires us to have a different vision of ourselves and our place in the world. We can no longer see ourselves as separated from the rest of the world by our borders. The world reaches in as much as we reach out. Foreign and domestic policy are no longer different disciplines. The ground on which the pillars of our security and prosperity rest is to be found as much in Asia or Africa as it is in France or Germany. Concern for the fate of others is therefore no longer 40 a philanthropic impulse to be indulged when we have addressed our internal priorities. The price of making the most of the opportunities of globalisation is that its responsibilities become imperatives, not options. The political choices we must make will define Europe’s identity. As with individuals or corporate bodies, self- definition is achieved through action. Who you are is symbiotic with what you do. Choices express values. The choices Europe makes will define whether it remains an open society in the face of increasing social and environmental pressures. To define the place of Europe in the world we must make different political choices about how we face the challenges of the 21st Century. Specific actions will flow out of these, and it will be through delivery that Europe will build itself the capacity to act. The means will flow from a clear vision of the purpose. The choices we must now make will define Europe’s future; its Europe in the World Europe’s choices', 'purpose; and its identity. Five initial choices are set out below. Redefining success Europe must be confident, not anxious. Anxiety paralyses, confidence energises. Rebuilding our confidence requires us to redefine the meaning of economic success. Europe has no choice but to go through a demographic trans- ition from rising to falling workforce as the population stabilises. The question is how well we manage the process. The criteria for success cannot simply be the raw GDP growth rates we currently use. These will obviously fall as the size of the European workforce stabilises and then falls. This will make European growth numerically only two thirds of that of the USA even if productivity and labour utilisation is identical. But this only matters if we continue to use outmoded 41 measures of success. For all its vaunted productivity growth, wages for most US workers have grown annually by only a fifth of the rate of productivity, as the distribution of the benefits of economic success has become ever more inequitable. As we know from our past, economic success cannot long be sustained if its destroys social cohesion. The EU15 achieve better health outcomes for less than half of the per capita health spending of the US. The countries regularly seen as most competitive in the EU – Finland, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands – all invest highly in core public goods and all sit at the top of European life satisfaction surveys. Building confidence in Europe’s economic future requires a political reframing of growth in terms of its quality rather than simply its quantity. The suite of measures and indicators defined during the Keynesian consensus offer little guidance Europe in the World Europe’s choices', 'as to how best to manage our core human, social and resource assets and even less on how to understand the future liabilities acquired by a resource and carbon intensive economy. We focus too much on the short term business cycle and not enough on long term structural issues. When Keynes said that we were all dead in the long run, he did not anticipate that the long run would get ever closer as the world reached 6.5 billion people. This reframing will be necessary to create the basis for a new social bargain. It should be underpinned by meaningful measures of sustainable prosperity such as well-being, income stability, environmental quality and social mobility. It should focus on managing the real assets underpinning the future success of the European economy: intellectual and human capital, social cohesion, and the effective provision of global public goods. 42 Building intergenerational cooperation Europe must build a new intergenerational contract between young and old. Today, we entrench defensiveness and disi- llusionment in young and old alike. For tomorrow, we must agree a fair sharing of future risks between the generations or we will fail to invest in a sustainable future. The critical political fault line in the future will not be between insiders and outsiders in the labour market. Nor will it be between labour and capital. It will be between generations. A bargain in which younger people shoulder the fiscal burden of an aging society, but have less economic security, while the economically established face lower prices and higher returns on their investments, is no bargain. It cannot be sustained. Increasingly tight environmental constraints will need to be managed by a younger generation Europe in the World Europe’s choices', 'which has not benefited from the era of cheap fuel and resources. Yet it is they who will bear the direct costs of climate change, resource depletion, water shortages and biodiversity loss. Unless a new politics of Europe generates intergenerational cooperation then more young people will leave for low tax economies. Those that remain may well reject higher investment in the public goods needed to secure Europe’s future security and prosperity; either to tackle climate change and energy security, or to invest in the political stability of Europe’s neighbourhood. The intergenerational cooperation essential for social cohesion needs to be built now. This means there must be a fairer sharing of the burden of public investment between generations. Just as we still benefit from public investment in civic infrastructure made over a century ago, today’s young people 43 must be able to benefit, as the 21st Century progresses, from wise investments we make now. The intergenerational dynamic must be reflected in how we make immediate decisions. Europe will soon undertake large reinvestment in basic energy infrastructure, including 50% of its current power stations. This long-lived investment needs to be resilient against the global realities of 2030, not just the short term economic demands of today. A key principle of achieving sustainable development is replacing resources and capital with intelligence and design. Putting this is into action would radically improve resource productivity in the European economy, alongside increasing labour productivity. Hedging against future climate and resource price risks will involve investing in flexibility and innovation, while avoiding rigid “mega-solutions”: road pricing to reduce congestion not new Europe in the World Europe’s choices', 'motorways; energy efficiency not new power stations; water efficiency not new dams; European innovation networks not new European industrial champions. Advances in materials science, nanotechnology and bio- technology promise to offer many more radical improve- ments, but only if successfully harnessed to the public purpose. The convergence of cheap communications, computing power and mobile personal devices has generated a host of possibilities for changing how infrastructure is designed, used and paid for, but only a fraction of these opportunities have yet been exploited at scale. These investments must be made today to provide a foundation for future prosperity and to enable a better intergenerational bargain. 44 Achieving energy security and climate security Europe must develop a low carbon economy without waiting for others. These twin challenges must be seen as an opportunity to drive forward innovation and efficiency, not as constraints on our growth. Europe cannot prosper in an unstable climate. Nor can it succeed without reliable and affordable access to energy services. This makes the transition to a global low carbon economy among the most important of Europe’s strategic interests. Failure to achieve either goal will result in rising political tensions, economic disruption and conflict as competition for increasingly scarce resources dominates global relationships. Europe will not fare well in such a world of competing powers, and neither will the values which bind us together. Europe has led the world in developing a coherent response Europe in the World Europe’s choices', 'to these twin challenges, but it has failed to match the scale and urgency of the problem, and still does not see them as issues essential to European security and prosperity. Our words have often been more compelling than our deeds. Short term national interests still dominate energy policy and prevent effective coordinated action, despite the fact that no one European country can achieve energy and climate security unilaterally. Moreover, energy and climate change policies are still dealt with separately, though both aim to influence investment in the same energy systems. For the European response to meet the scale of the challenge, energy and climate security must become part of the core of the new European project in the way that food security and the single market have defined the past. Progress towards achieving energy and climate security should become the critical measure by which Europe’s ability 45 to generate political purpose is judged. Success will depend on the scale of Europe’s ambition being sufficient to shift global politics and global markets. This will require real leadership and determination to build the alliances which preserve European security and prosperity. Investing in a successful China Europe must engage positively with China on the basis of mutual interests. We must not see our relationship with China simply as a fractious competition for contract\n",

Conclusions Several models exist to curb right-wing populist parties and movements within the and recommendations European Union, although Germany’s approaches are just as unconvincing as the reactions of her European neighbours. While right-wing populist parties in Sweden, France and the United Kingdom are increasingly setting the political agenda, the shift to the right in Germany is largely taking place outside the party spectrum – that is to say, on the streets. The central task of politicians in achieving domestic acceptance of a large influx of migrants is the enforcement of the existing legal framework and making a distinction in the asylum procedure between vulnerable people and migrants. What is required, alongside moves to strengthen the primacy of the rule of law, is a debate on the aims of and limits to immigration. 1. Introduction In recent years, crises, wars, social inequalities and demographic trends in the MENA region and Central Africa have resulted in an unprecedented increase in migration, for which Europe has been insufficiently prepared and which has placed the mutual solidarity of the EU Member States under unremitting strain.1 In 2013 some 435,000 applications for asylum were submitted across Europe. In 2014 this figure mushroomed to 625,000.2 Current forecasts place the number of applications for asylum in Germany alone at over 800,000 in 2015.3 Given the intensity of inter-denominational and geopolitical conflicts, the fragility of state structures in the MENA region and the projected doubling of the African popu- lation by the middle of this century, the European Union faces a long-term chal- The challenges lie in lenge, to which the Member States must find coherent foreign and domestic policy the fair distribution of responses. While the European Union is at its external border confronted with a migrants and refugees moral dilemma between the need to protect refugees and the need to safeguard its within the EU and the own frontiers,4 significant challenges are also arising within the EU. At pan-Europe- fight against right- an level these are, on the one hand, the equitable distribution of migrants and refu- and left-wing popu- gees in the spirit of solidarity, and, on the other, the growth of right- and left-wing lism. populist movements, between which an unbridgeable gulf is increasingly opening up in respect of European asylum policy and which are contributing to domestic politi- cal tensions, in Germany and elsewhere.5 Against the backdrop of growing scepticism towards multicultural societal models, Islamist attacks in Western Europe and the lack of Eastern European countries‘ experience with multiculturalism of the EU’s western Member States, Europe's polit- ical elites and national populations alike are being forced to find sustainable solu- tions to the refugee crisis. German Government officials in particular have com- plained in the past that the distribution of refugees within Europe is divisive and unjust and demanded a much stronger burden-sharing.6\", 'FACTS & FINDINGS | OCTOBER 2015 | NO. 193 | 3 The following article represents an attempt to explain these “domestic” European problems, in the first instance through an analysis of the current situation coupled with the historical development of European asylum policy. The article then goes on to compare the differences in the implementation of asylum policy in the EU Mem- ber States and to assess the key obstacles that have thus far prevented the “Euro- peanisation” of asylum policy. The second part of the analysis focuses on the chal- lenges posed by populist parties and movements, which are gaining popularity on the back of the refugee problem and the selective enforcement of existing legisla- tion. Finally, possible solutions are outlined with regard to European asylum policy and populist movements. 2. Outlining the problem a) The failure of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS) With the Dublin Regulation, concluded in 1990 and enacted in 1997, the interna- tional legal foundations for the Common European Asylum System (CEAS) were laid. The regulation followed the principle of “One refugee, one state”, intended as a means to combat illegal migration within the EU (“no refugees in orbit”). The Dublin The Dublin procedure procedure lays down criteria for the jurisdiction of the EU Member States over asy- for the registration of lum procedures. In principle, the Member State of first entry is also responsible for asylum seekers was a processing the asylum application. The Dublin procedure assigns both legal and central plank of the political responsibility to the state through which the asylum seeker first enters the Schengen Agreement. EU, regards the fulfilment of its national responsibility to protect and control the border and to prevent migrants from unobstructed passage to other states. Along- side the harmonisation of entry regulations, these provisions are a central element of the Schengen Agreement, which provides for the removal of checks on individu- als at the internal borders between the contracting European countries. Already back in the 1990s, the objective of European asylum policy went beyond the mere establishment of national responsibility. Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) emphasises the “principle of solidarity” in the “fair sharing of responsibility, including its financial implications, between the Member States”.7 The measure was aimed at the approximating quotas of guaran- teed asylum permits alongside the enforcement of standards and the protection of The European Union the rights of asylum seekers.8 With the FRONTEX regulation of 2007/2004, the and Germany have Member States laid down the conditions for the European Border Agency. Reception never been a “fort- guidelines including policies for accommodation and care (Council Directive 2003/9 ress”. EC), qualification guidelines on the minimum standards for the recognition of asy- lum seekers (Council Directive 2003/109/EC), and a Asylum Procedure Directive (Council Directive 2005/85/EC) were successively established. At the end of the 1990s the European Union adapted the principle of non-refoulement, which prohib- its the individual EU Member States from deporting refugees who enjoy protection under the objective criteria of the Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Ref- ugees.9 Contrary to the public perception of a “Fortress Europe”, both the European Union and Germany thereby liberalised the legal criteria in favour of asylum seek- ers, expanding the category of persons entitled to protection, as well as the recog- nition criteria and procedures.10 Despite the creation of a pan-European refugee fund (AMIF) and the European Asy- lum and Immigration Pact together with the EASO Office (European Asylum Support Office), the “Europeanisation” of asylum policy over the last decades has failed. On the one hand, the admission quotas for asylum seekers – even for those who are seeking refuge for the same reasons from the very same states – differ widely', 'FACTS & FINDINGS | OCTOBER 2015 | NO. 193 | 4 between the EU Member States. On the other, the reception of asylum seekers was limited to a few European States.11 In 2014, according to absolute figures, the five The implementation of EU states Germany, Sweden, Italy, France and Hungary were responsible for the Dublin Agreement three-quarters of all the asylum procedures in the EU.

Copenhagen, 13 October 2005 Throughout Europe, in different countries, a current debate is concerned with the issue of guaranteeing a better integration of foreign citizens arriving in Western countries, while maintaining and fostering their relationships and linkages with countries of origin. The unsuccessful assimilation policies as well awareness that reducing migration flows is not a solution - other than for creating irregular flows - brought this issue in the public sphere and on the media. What we will argue in our presentation is that promoting the relationship between integration and transnationalism could become the key issue for managing migration flows with the objective of achieving common development goals. The concept we wish to introduce here is of ‘transnational integration’, which is indeed still underdeveloped or absent in many actions and assessments undertaken by researchers and policy makers. In our opinion it is a relevant concept as it could serve as the logical framework for a multilevel dialogue between sub-national, national and European institutions which may take place with the aim of managing positively migration flows. 1', 'However for this strategy to be achieved, it is necessary both at the national of both origin and destination countries and at the European level to overcome the political conceptions centred on security and the reduction of migration flows. Further, as we shall demonstrate in the course of the presentation it is important that at the European level the role of local authorities is recognised systematically and coherently since these actors – as we shall see for the Italian case – are the best candidates in managing simultaneously integration needs, demands and the feeling of ‘double belonging’ of migrant communities residing in their territories. In the first part of our presentation we will focus on the process that - at least in Italy - gave local authorities an active role in managing migration flows. We will then indicate the innovative aspects and the limits of such local policies through the description of two case studies that saw the involvement of the Moroccan community. In the second part of this article we shall spell out the need for a systematic approach unifying and merging integration and transnational development, going beyond interventions and projects that too often end with their pilot phase. Finally we shall mention how the European Neighbourhood Policy may constitute a positive answer wherein migrants and local authorities could become active actors proposing innovative contents. Glocal migration and the new role of local authorities The literature on international migration shows today migration flows as networks of different nature linking directly specific geographical areas both of origin and destination countries. In a growing globalisation of markets and societies this phenomenon shows the emergence of the local dimension and it does not seem incorrect to speak of a new phase of ‘glocalisation’ of migration flows, where global and local interact continuously, where the interdependence of economies and societies is combined with a process of localisation of migration dynamics, linked to productive demands of specific territorial areas and economic sectors. In the Post-Fordist Era economic development no longer takes place in the big industry, but appears instead organised in a myriad of little nets of small and medium enterprises 2', 'and industrial districts with strong productive specialisations, while employment in the service sector becomes relevant especially in the so called ‘global cities’. In countries like Spain and Italy which do not operate any selection on migration flows based on professional skills, migrants find jobs in the local systems often in occupations at the lowest levels: i.e. as generic or domestic workers. The demand for foreign labour is different in time and space following the economic needs and developmental perspectives that characterize the different local contexts. Flexibility in the labour market broadens the differentiation of professional profiles opening a large spectrum of atypical jobs, often unstable, and without social protection. All this can make it very difficult for governments to manage flows ‘from above’ since these appear difficult to foresee, monitor and manage at the central level, thus an increasingly important role in the area of migration policies is played by sub-national institutions. In this context, where sub national institutions gain centrality, local authorities broadened their functions: initially providing welfare and social integration policies, which on migration issues would translate in reception and access to service policies (healthcare schooling etc.), today instead they promote economic development in order to regulate the local labour market according to development demands of their territories, therefore including recruitment and training policies for migrants. In dealing with these new functions local authorities establish relationships with sub national government and sometimes central institutions in countries of origin in order to manage – in a cooperative way - migration flows with the aim of fostering mobility as a resource for common development. An interesting example is represented by the case of the Region of Andalusia in Spain: the Region signed directly with the Moroccan government an agreement in order to manage emigration flows arriving from this country. This partnership includes inter alia labour policies, policies directed at minors, creation of ‘reception’ centres in the countries of origin.. Similar examples can be found in Italy where some regions collaborate with central governmental institutions of emigration countries for recruiting – within the quota agreements established by the Italian government – foreign workers to be inserted in relevant sectors for the regional economies. For instance, the Italian Ministry of Welfare 3', 'with the Veneto Region together with trade unions, and training centres, are recruiting 80 workers for the construction industry from different countries including Romania. Shifts in migration and development policies undertaken by Italian local authorities: two case studies In Italy, over recent years, sub-national governments (particularly Regions and Municipalities) rather than the central government, have played an increasingly important role in trying to shape (at times unintentionally) a co-development approach in migration and cooperation policies On the one hand, local authorities have concrete competencies for the integration of migrants in their specific territories, and on the other they have an increased awareness of the trans-local dimension of migration which is creating direct ties between territories of origin and destination. Consequently they have reacted to this new glocal interdependency, connecting migration and development ‘here, there and inbetween’. Over the last years a range of pilot schemes in the area of co-development have been put in place1. What is new in these projects is what we can call a methodological approach to managing migration-development policies: a ‘partnership’ approach where actors promoting such practices include Municipalities, Provinces, Regions as well as migrant associations, NGOs and the private sector, in one word, the whole set of actors of the so- called decentralised cooperation. In order to give a more precise picture of what we are saying, we will present two pilot projects which have been recently undertaken by the Italian decentralised cooperation. The first project (which is still on-going) has been funded by the region Emilia- Romagna and implemented, among others by an organization, Nextia: a private company linked to the consortium of the Emilia Romagna’s productive cooperatives. Each season cooperatives from the region Emilia-Romagna use seasonal workers from Morocco for the cultivation of agricultural products also grown in the area of Khouribga. In the first phase of the project, a network of Italian and Moroccan joint 1 CeSPI has a data base of more than 60 projects, (a very high number in comparison with the few projects promoted at the central level). 4', 'ventures or Moroccan cooperatives for the cultivation and processing of organic products will be set up in Khouribga. The network will be promoted, supporting the internationalisation of Italian productive cooperatives and the reinforcement/creation of Moroccan cooperatives or SMEs (small and medium enterprises) . At the same time trade agreements between Morocco and Italy will be endorsed for marketing Moroccan products in Italy through the commercial network of cooperatives in Emilia Romagna. In the second phase Moroccan seasonal workers – many of which have worked for the Italian cooperatives during several seasons – will be trained as agricultural technicians and, once back, hired as skilled workers in the cooperatives of the network or assisted in setting up their own cooperatives taking part in the network. The project is particularly interesting as it aims at the creation of trans-local economic circuits within which migrants can play the role of labourers, facilitators or direct in\n"
